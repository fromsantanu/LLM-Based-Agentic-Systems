# Chapter 5: Anchors and Boundaries

Anchors and boundaries are special constructs in regular expressions that allow you to **control the position** of your matches within a string, rather than matching specific characters.

---

## 1. The `^` Anchor (Start of String)

* `^` matches **the beginning of a string** (or the beginning of a line in multiline mode).

### Example 1 â€“ Match words starting with `Hello`

```python
import re

text = "Hello world\nPython says Hello again"
pattern = r"^Hello"

# Without multiline flag
print(re.findall(pattern, text))  
# Output: ['Hello']

# With multiline flag
print(re.findall(pattern, text, re.MULTILINE))
# Output: ['Hello', 'Hello']
```

ðŸ‘‰ Without `re.MULTILINE`, `^` matches only at the start of the whole string.
ðŸ‘‰ With `re.MULTILINE`, `^` matches at the start of **each line**.

---

## 2. The `$` Anchor (End of String)

* `$` matches **the end of a string** (or the end of a line in multiline mode).

### Example 2 â€“ Match words ending with `again`

```python
text = "This is fun\nDo it again"
pattern = r"again$"

print(re.findall(pattern, text))  
# Output: ['again']

print(re.findall(pattern, text, re.MULTILINE))
# Output: ['again']
```

ðŸ‘‰ `$` ensures the match occurs **right before the end of the string** (or line in multiline mode).

---

## 3. Using Both `^` and `$`

* Combine them to match the **entire string**.

### Example 3 â€“ Match full string

```python
text = "Python3"
pattern = r"^Python3$"

print(bool(re.match(pattern, text)))
# Output: True

print(bool(re.match(r"^Python$", text)))
# Output: False
```

ðŸ‘‰ `^pattern$` means the whole string must exactly match `pattern`.

---

## 4. The `\b` Word Boundary

* `\b` matches a **word boundary**: the position between a word character (`\w`) and a non-word character (`\W`) or string edges.

### Example 4 â€“ Match words starting with `cat`

```python
text = "cat scatter cater category"
pattern = r"\bcat"

print(re.findall(pattern, text))
# Output: ['cat', 'cat']
```

ðŸ‘‰ Only matches standalone `cat` or when it appears at the start of a word.
ðŸ‘‰ Doesnâ€™t match inside `"scatter"`.

---

### Example 5 â€“ Match words ending with `ing`

```python
text = "I am running, jumping, and eating."
pattern = r"ing\b"

print(re.findall(pattern, text))
# Output: ['ing', 'ing', 'ing']
```

ðŸ‘‰ `\b` ensures `ing` is at the end of a word.

---

### Example 6 â€“ Negating with `\B`

* `\B` matches positions that are **not at word boundaries**.

```python
text = "scatter cater category"
pattern = r"\Bcat"

print(re.findall(pattern, text))
# Output: ['cat']
```

ðŸ‘‰ Here, `\Bcat` matches `"cat"` only when it occurs inside a word.

---

## Summary

* `^` â†’ Start of string (or line with `MULTILINE`).
* `$` â†’ End of string (or line with `MULTILINE`).
* `\b` â†’ Word boundary.
* `\B` â†’ Not a word boundary.

These anchors and boundaries are crucial when you need **exact control over where matches occur**.
