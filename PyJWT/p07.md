# **Lesson 7: Advanced Use Cases (Optional)**

Now that you know how to create, verify, and use JWTs in FastAPI, let’s look at some **advanced scenarios**.
These are optional, but understanding them will help you build **secure and professional-level applications**.

### 🧩 1. JWT with Asymmetric Encryption (RS256)

So far, we have used **HS256**, which depends on a single secret key.
Both **encoding (creating)** and **decoding (verifying)** the token use the same secret.

But in big systems, that’s not always safe — because if the secret key is leaked, **anyone can create fake tokens**.

That’s where **asymmetric encryption (RS256)** comes in.

* It uses **two keys**:

  * 🔐 **Private Key** — used by the server to *create* tokens.
  * 🔓 **Public Key** — shared with others to *verify* tokens.

This means your backend can issue tokens, and other services (like a mobile app or another API) can verify them using the **public key** without ever knowing your private key.

✅ **Example idea:**
You store the private key safely in the backend, and give your public key to your partner services.
They can check if the token is valid, but they cannot create new ones.

### 🔑 2. Using PyJWT with `OAuth2PasswordBearer` Flow

FastAPI already supports a standard security system called **OAuth2PasswordBearer**.
This is just a fancy term for “**Login → Get Token → Use Token**” flow.

Here’s how it works:

1. A user sends their **username and password** to the login API.
2. If correct, your backend creates and returns a **JWT access token**.
3. For every protected route, the user must send this token in the header:

   ```
   Authorization: Bearer <access_token>
   ```
4. FastAPI uses the **OAuth2PasswordBearer** dependency to automatically:

   * Extract the token from the header.
   * Verify it using PyJWT.
   * Allow or deny access.

✅ **This flow is widely used** in professional web apps — it’s clean, secure, and standard.

### 🌐 3. Integrating with Third-Party Identity Providers

Sometimes you don’t want to handle user logins yourself.
Instead, you let trusted services (like **Google**, **GitHub**, or **Facebook**) handle authentication.

These services issue JWTs after successful login — and your app can **verify those JWTs** instead of creating its own.

This is called **“Login with Google”** or **Single Sign-On (SSO)**.

✅ **Example idea:**

* The user logs in with Google.
* Google gives your app a token.
* Your backend verifies that token (using Google’s public key).
* You accept the login — no password storage needed!

### 💡 Summary

| Concept                  | Description                                                             |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **RS256**                | Uses private/public keys for secure token handling                      |
| **OAuth2PasswordBearer** | Standard FastAPI flow for secure login and token usage                  |
| **Third-party login**    | Use tokens from Google or GitHub instead of managing passwords yourself |

### 🧠 Final Thought

These advanced cases are not mandatory for small apps,
but they become **essential when your application grows**,
especially if you have **multiple services, partner APIs, or mobile clients**.
