# üß© Lesson 1: Introduction to JWT & PyJWT

## üî∑ What is a JWT (JSON Web Token)?

A **JWT (JSON Web Token)** is a small piece of text that acts like an **identity card** for a user on the internet.

When you log in to a website or app, the server gives you a **token** (a special string).
Later, whenever you make a request (like visiting your profile or posting data), you send this token to prove **who you are** ‚Äî so you don‚Äôt have to log in again every time.

‚úÖ Think of it like:

> You show your ID card at the gate once, and then the guard remembers you by your badge, not your face.

So in simple terms:

* A **JWT** is a digital badge that confirms your identity.
* It helps systems know **you are allowed** to do something.

## üî∑ Why JWT is used in FastAPI?

FastAPI uses JWT mainly for two reasons:

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Authentication ‚Äî *‚ÄúWho are you?‚Äù*

When you log in, FastAPI checks your username and password.
If correct, it creates a **JWT token** and gives it to you.
Next time, you send this token with your request, and FastAPI knows it‚Äôs *you*.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Authorization ‚Äî *‚ÄúWhat are you allowed to do?‚Äù*

Once FastAPI knows who you are, it can check what you can access ‚Äî for example:

* A normal user may view data.
* An admin may add or delete data.

JWT helps FastAPI **decide permissions** easily.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Stateless sessions

JWTs make the system **stateless**, meaning:

* The server doesn‚Äôt have to ‚Äúremember‚Äù each user‚Äôs session.
* All the needed info is inside the token itself.
* This makes FastAPI **faster and simpler** to scale.

## üî∑ Structure of a JWT

A JWT has **three parts**, separated by dots (`.`):

```
Header.Payload.Signature
```

Example:

```
eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.
eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjoxMjMsInJvbGUiOiJhZG1pbiJ9.
TJVA95OrM7E2cBab30RMHrHDcEfxjoYZgeFONFh7HgQ
```

Let‚Äôs break it down:

| Part          | Meaning                                             | Example Content                            |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **Header**    | Says what kind of token and which algorithm is used | `{ "alg": "HS256", "typ": "JWT" }`         |
| **Payload**   | The actual data (like user id, role, expiry time)   | `{ "user_id": 123, "role": "admin" }`      |
| **Signature** | A secret key that ensures the token wasn‚Äôt changed  | A long string generated using a secret key |

So, when FastAPI receives a token, it **verifies the signature** to make sure it‚Äôs genuine.

## üî∑ Installing and Importing PyJWT

**PyJWT** is a Python library that helps you create and read (encode and decode) JWT tokens easily.

To install:

```bash
pip install PyJWT
```

Then, in your FastAPI code:

```python
import jwt
```

That‚Äôs it ‚Äî now you can create tokens and verify them.

## ü™Ñ Quick Recap

| Concept      | Meaning                         |
| ------------ | ------------------------------- |
| **JWT**      | A digital identity card (token) |
| **Used for** | Authentication & Authorization  |
| **3 parts**  | Header, Payload, Signature      |
| **Library**  | PyJWT (`pip install PyJWT`)     |
