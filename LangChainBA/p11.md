# 11. Specialized Use Cases

As you become comfortable with the foundations of LangChain‚Äîchains, memory, retrieval, and agents‚Äîyou‚Äôll want to explore more **advanced, specialized use cases**. These often combine multiple data formats, modalities, or agents to build systems closer to real-world production deployments. This chapter introduces key patterns and examples.

## 11.1 RAG with PDFs, Docs, and Multi-format Data

Most enterprise data lives in **heterogeneous formats**: PDFs, Word docs, spreadsheets, presentations, and structured databases. LangChain provides connectors and loaders to normalize these into text chunks, which can then be embedded into a vector database for **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**.

**Workflow**:

1. **Load**: Use `langchain.document_loaders` to parse PDFs (`PyPDFLoader`), Word docs (`UnstructuredWordDocumentLoader`), or CSVs (`CSVLoader`).
2. **Chunk**: Apply `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter` to create overlapping chunks.
3. **Embed**: Convert chunks into embeddings (`OpenAIEmbeddings`, `SentenceTransformersEmbeddings`).
4. **Store & Retrieve**: Insert into a vector store (`FAISS`, `Chroma`, `Pinecone`) and query with retrievers.
5. **Generate**: Provide retrieved context to the LLM for grounded responses.

**Example**:

* A research assistant querying scientific PDFs across multiple formats.
* Compliance system extracting policies from DOCX files and comparing with CSV checklists.

## 11.2 Multi-Modal Pipelines

Real-world problems often involve more than just text. LangChain supports **multi-modal pipelines** where models can handle **image, text, audio, and video inputs**.

### Image + Text (OpenAI Vision, CLIP)

* **OpenAI Vision Models**: Accept both image and text prompts.
  Example: Upload a chart image and ask, *‚ÄúSummarize the trend shown here.‚Äù*
* **CLIP (Contrastive Language‚ÄìImage Pretraining)**: Aligns text and image embeddings in the same space.
  Use cases:

  * Image search by text query.
  * Automatic image captioning.
  * Filtering retrieved documents by associated diagrams.

**Pipeline Example**:

1. Extract image features via CLIP.
2. Align with text embeddings.
3. Combine retrieval (text + image context) before generation.

## 11.3 Knowledge Graph Integration

While vector databases excel at **semantic similarity search**, they don‚Äôt capture **relationships** between entities as explicitly as a **Knowledge Graph (KG)**.

LangChain integrates with tools like **Neo4j** or **TigerGraph**:

* Build a KG of entities and relationships (patients, diagnoses, treatments in healthcare, for instance).
* Use LLMs to **translate queries** into Cypher or SPARQL.
* Combine KG retrieval with vector search for **hybrid reasoning**.

**Example**:

* Medical assistant: ‚ÄúFind all patients diagnosed with asthma who were prescribed inhalers in the last 6 months.‚Äù
* The query can be decomposed into **structured graph queries** + **semantic RAG** for explanatory notes.

## 11.4 Multi-Agent Systems

LangChain allows you to create **agents with specialized roles** that collaborate in solving complex tasks.

**Patterns**:

* **Specialist Agents**:

  * Research agent ‚Üí finds documents.
  * Analyst agent ‚Üí interprets results.
  * Writer agent ‚Üí produces final report.
* **Debate/Consensus Agents**: Multiple agents argue or vote, improving reliability.
* **Manager/Worker Hierarchies**:

  * Manager agent decomposes a task.
  * Worker agents execute subtasks and return results.

**Example**:

* In finance: one agent retrieves stock data, another performs time-series analysis, and a third writes client-ready insights.

## 11.5 Workflow Orchestration

As pipelines get more complex, orchestration becomes crucial. LangChain introduced **LangGraph**, a next-generation workflow framework.

### LangGraph Overview

* Built on **directed graphs of nodes** (each node = LLM call, tool, or agent).
* Supports **branching, conditional logic, retries, and state tracking**.
* More scalable than linear chains/agents for **production workflows**.

**Benefits**:

* Visualize complex flows like ETL pipelines.
* Mix deterministic steps (DB queries) with probabilistic steps (LLM reasoning).
* Pause/resume long workflows (e.g., human-in-the-loop review).

**Example**:

* A clinical decision support system:

  * Intake node ‚Üí symptom parsing.
  * Retrieval node ‚Üí medical guideline lookup.
  * Analysis node ‚Üí draft recommendation.
  * Review node ‚Üí escalate to human doctor if uncertain.
