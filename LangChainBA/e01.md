## Example: A Python Script That Asks GPT-4 to Summarize a Short Text

### 1. Install required libraries

```bash
pip install langchain langchain-openai
```

---

### 2. Set your API key

Export your OpenAI key to your environment:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"    # Linux/Mac
setx OPENAI_API_KEY "your_api_key_here"      # Windows
```

---

### 3. Python script

```python
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
from langchain.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate

# Initialize GPT-4 model
llm = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o-mini", temperature=0)

# Create a summarization prompt
prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_template(
    "Summarize the following text in 2-3 sentences:\n\n{text}"
)

# Example input text
text_to_summarize = """
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming industries worldwide. 
From healthcare to finance, AI systems are improving decision-making, 
increasing efficiency, and opening new possibilities. 
However, challenges such as ethics, bias, and job displacement must be addressed 
for AI to reach its full potential.
"""

# Format the prompt with input text
formatted_prompt = prompt.format_messages(text=text_to_summarize)

# Get response from GPT-4
response = llm.invoke(formatted_prompt)

# Print summary
print("Summary:", response.content)
```

---

### 4. Expected Output

For the input above, GPT-4 might return something like:

```
Summary: AI is revolutionizing industries by enhancing efficiency and decision-making. 
Despite its benefits, ethical concerns, bias, and job displacement remain key challenges 
that must be resolved for AI to realize its full potential.
```

---

âœ… **How it works:**

1. `ChatOpenAI` connects to GPT-4.
2. `ChatPromptTemplate` defines the summarization task.
3. `format_messages` inserts your text into the template.
4. `llm.invoke()` sends it to GPT-4 and retrieves the result.
