## Example: A Python Script That Asks GPT-4 to Summarize a Short Text

### 1. Install required libraries

```bash
pip install langchain langchain-openai
```

---

### 2. Set your API key

Create an .env file with following content in your working directory ..
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=<your key>

```

---

### 3. Python script

```python
from dotenv import load_dotenv
import os
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
from langchain.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate


# Load environment variables
load_dotenv()

# Initialize GPT-4 model
llm = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o-mini", temperature=0)


# Create a summarization prompt
prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_template(
    "Summarize the following text in 2-3 sentences:\n\n{text}"
)


# Example input text
text_to_summarize = """
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming industries worldwide. 
From healthcare to finance, AI systems are improving decision-making, 
increasing efficiency, and opening new possibilities. 
However, challenges such as ethics, bias, and job displacement must be addressed 
for AI to reach its full potential.
"""


# New style: pipe prompt into llm
chain = prompt | llm

# Run the chain
response = chain.invoke({"text": text_to_summarize})
print("Summary:", response.content)
```

---

### 4. Expected Output

For the input above, GPT-4 might return something like:

```
Summary: AI is revolutionizing industries by enhancing efficiency and decision-making. 
Despite its benefits, ethical concerns, bias, and job displacement remain key challenges 
that must be resolved for AI to realize its full potential.
```

---

âœ… **How it works:**

1. `ChatOpenAI` connects to GPT-4.
2. `ChatPromptTemplate` defines the summarization task.
3. `format_messages` inserts your text into the template.
4. `llm.invoke()` sends it to GPT-4 and retrieves the result.
