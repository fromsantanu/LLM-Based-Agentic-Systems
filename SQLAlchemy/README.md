# SQLAlchemy Package - Connecting to RDBMS Databases

## üß© **Part 1 ‚Äî Foundations of SQLAlchemy**

**Goal:** Understand what SQLAlchemy is and how it works with Python and databases.

1. **Introduction to SQLAlchemy**

   * What is SQLAlchemy?
   * ORM vs Core
   * Supported databases and installation
   * Architecture overview: Engine, Connection, and Session

2. **Setting up SQLAlchemy**

   * Installing `SQLAlchemy` and database drivers
   * Creating a database engine (`create_engine()`)
   * Understanding database URLs
   * Basic connection and executing raw SQL

3. **SQLAlchemy Core Basics**

   * Metadata and Table objects
   * Defining tables with `Table`, `Column`, and `MetaData`
   * Data types (`Integer`, `String`, `DateTime`, etc.)
   * Inserting, selecting, updating, deleting with Core API
   * Using textual SQL (`text()`)

---

## üß± **Part 2 ‚Äî Working with the ORM (Object Relational Mapper)**

**Goal:** Map Python classes to database tables.

4. **Declarative Base and ORM Mapping**

   * `declarative_base()` and defining models
   * Primary keys and unique constraints
   * Column attributes and relationships
   * Creating tables from ORM models (`Base.metadata.create_all()`)

5. **CRUD Operations with ORM**

   * Creating a session (`sessionmaker`)
   * Inserting records (`add`, `add_all`, `commit`)
   * Querying (`session.query`, `filter`, `filter_by`)
   * Updating and deleting records

6. **Relationships Between Tables**

   * One-to-Many, Many-to-One, and Many-to-Many
   * Using `relationship()` and `back_populates`
   * Lazy vs Eager loading
   * Cascades and orphan deletion

7. **Advanced Querying**

   * Using `select()`, `join()`, and subqueries
   * Aggregations and group by
   * Aliases and labeling
   * Hybrid properties

## ‚öôÔ∏è **Part 3 ‚Äî Schema, Metadata, and Reflection**

**Goal:** Understand and manipulate the database schema programmatically.

8. **Metadata Deep Dive**

   * Using `MetaData()` effectively
   * Reflecting existing databases
   * Inspecting tables dynamically (`inspect()`)

9. **Migrations with Alembic**

   * Introduction to Alembic
   * Creating revision scripts
   * Auto-generating migrations
   * Applying upgrades and downgrades

---

## üß† **Part 4 ‚Äî Best Practices and Advanced Concepts**

**Goal:** Learn how to structure, optimize, and maintain large projects.

10. **Session Management and Transactions**

    * Transaction scopes
    * Commit and rollback
    * Expiring and refreshing objects
    * Context-managed sessions

11. **Eager vs Lazy Loading**

    * Performance trade-offs
    * Using `selectinload`, `joinedload`, `subqueryload`

12. **Events and Hooks**

    * Using `event.listen()`
    * Automating timestamps (created_at, updated_at)
    * Triggers and custom validation

13. **Optimizations and Performance**

    * Batching and bulk operations
    * Query caching
    * Indexing and constraints
    * Profiling SQL queries

---

## üß∞ **Part 5 ‚Äî Integration and Real-World Usage**

**Goal:** Use SQLAlchemy effectively in production systems.

14. **Integration with FastAPI / Flask**

    * Dependency injection with sessions
    * Handling async SQLAlchemy (using `async_engine`)
    * Using Pydantic models with ORM

15. **Using SQLAlchemy with Databases**

    * SQLite (local testing)
    * PostgreSQL and MySQL configuration
    * Connection pooling

16. **Testing and CI/CD**

    * Setting up test databases
    * Using fixtures with pytest
    * Mocking sessions and queries

17. **Packaging and Reusability**

    * Creating a data access layer (DAL)
    * Repository pattern with SQLAlchemy
    * Maintaining models in modular architecture

---

## üîç **Part 6 ‚Äî Hands-On Projects**

**Goal:** Reinforce learning with practical examples.

18. **Mini Projects**

    * Simple To-Do application
    * Library management system
    * Blog with users and posts

19. **Advanced Projects**

    * Healthcare patient record system (multi-table ORM)
    * E-commerce order management system
    * FastAPI + SQLAlchemy + Alembic full-stack app

20. **Deployment**

    * Using Docker with PostgreSQL and SQLAlchemy
    * Running migrations automatically on startup
    * Managing environment variables securely
