# 📘 LangGraph Learning Roadmap - Beginner to Advanced

## 1. **Foundations**

1. **What is LangGraph?**

   * Concept of stateful agent orchestration and differences from LangChain.
   * 🔹 *Example*: Compare a simple LangChain sequential chain vs a LangGraph workflow.
2. **Core Concepts**

   * **Nodes**, **Edges**, **State**, **Channels**, **Graph execution model**.
   * 🔹 *Example*: Create a graph with two nodes — one generating text, another summarizing it.
3. **Installation & Setup**

   * Installing LangGraph, environment requirements, and running the first graph.
   * 🔹 *Example*: Install LangGraph and run a “Hello World Graph” that passes text through a node.

## 2. **Building Blocks**

4. **Defining Nodes**

   * Functions as nodes, types of nodes (LLM, tool, custom logic).
   * 🔹 *Example*: Node1 → take a number, Node2 → multiply by 2.
5. **Edges & Flow Control**

   * Direct edges, conditional edges, parallel edges.
   * 🔹 *Example*: Branch text sentiment into “positive” and “negative” summarizers.
6. **State Management**

   * Shared state, channels, reducers, persistence.
   * 🔹 *Example*: Track conversation history across nodes.
7. **Async & Streaming**

   * Handling async tasks and real-time streaming updates.
   * 🔹 *Example*: Stream an LLM’s response while it’s being generated.

## 3. **Patterns of Use**

8. **Sequential Graphs**

   * Node → Node → Node linear execution.
   * 🔹 *Example*: Input → Clean text → Summarize → Store in file.
9. **Branching Graphs**

   * Multiple paths, conditional execution.
   * 🔹 *Example*: Classify query type (Math vs Text) → Send to solver or summarizer.
10. **Looping & Iteration**

    * Self-loops for retries, iterative refinement.
    * 🔹 *Example*: RAG query refinement until confidence score ≥ threshold.
11. **Parallel Execution**

    * Run multiple nodes at once.
    * 🔹 *Example*: Summarize text in 3 styles (formal, casual, bullet points) concurrently.

## 4. **Integrations**

12. **LangChain Compatibility**

    * Using LangChain tools, retrievers, and agents inside LangGraph.
    * 🔹 *Example*: Add a LangChain retriever node for document Q\&A.
13. **Tool Integration**

    * External APIs, databases, custom Python functions.
    * 🔹 *Example*: Call a weather API from one node and generate a travel suggestion.
14. **Memory & Persistence**

    * Storing state in Redis, SQL, or file-based memory.
    * 🔹 *Example*: Build a chatbot that “remembers” user preferences across sessions.

---

## 5. **Error Handling & Guards**

15. **Retries & Fallbacks**

    * Retry nodes, fallback paths for errors.
    * 🔹 *Example*: If LLM fails → Use regex-based extractor as backup.
16. **Compliance & Validation**

    * Add guardrails for outputs (schema validation, moderation).
    * 🔹 *Example*: Ensure generated medical advice always includes a disclaimer.

---

## 6. **Advanced Architectures**

17. **Multi-Agent Systems**

    * Different specialized agents working together.
    * 🔹 *Example*: Doctor Agent → Diagnostic Agent → Treatment Planner Agent.
18. **Human-in-the-Loop**

    * Adding approval/review steps in the workflow.
    * 🔹 *Example*: AI drafts an email → Human approves → AI sends.
19. **Pause & Resume**

    * Stateful workflows that persist and continue later.
    * 🔹 *Example*: Patient intake workflow that pauses until lab results arrive.
20. **Hierarchical Graphs**

    * Subgraphs and modular design.
    * 🔹 *Example*: “Research Assistant Graph” that internally uses smaller graphs (search, summarize, draft).

---

## 7. **Deployment & Scaling**

21. **Running Locally**

    * CLI usage, debugging, and logging.

* 🔹 *Example*: Run a local chatbot graph and monitor state transitions.

22. **Production Deployment**

    * APIs, serverless, Docker, monitoring.

* 🔹 *Example*: Expose your triage graph as an API endpoint.

23. **Optimization**

    * Performance tuning, caching, batching.

* 🔹 *Example*: Cache embeddings across runs to reduce cost.

## 8. **Domain-Specific Projects (Capstones)**

24. **Customer Support Assistant**

    * Multi-step workflow with classification, FAQ retrieval, escalation.
25. **Medical Triage System**

    * Intake → Symptom classifier → Diagnostic → Recommendation.
26. **Document Workflow**

    * Upload → OCR → Summarize → Store → Retrieve on query.
27. **Education Tutor**

    * Q\&A + quiz generation with stateful progress tracking.
