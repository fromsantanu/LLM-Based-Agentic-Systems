# Chapter 19: Pause & Resume

One of the most powerful features of **LangGraph** is its ability to support **stateful workflows** that can pause and later resume from the exact point they left off. This is especially critical in real-world applications where external dependencies (e.g., human actions, API responses, test results) may take minutes, hours, or even days.

Instead of restarting the entire workflow, LangGraph allows you to **persist state**, wait for an event or input, and continue execution seamlessly.

## üîë Why Pause & Resume Matters

* **Realistic workflows**: Many business and healthcare processes take time (e.g., waiting for approval, results, or payment).
* **Efficiency**: Prevents recomputation by resuming from the last checkpoint.
* **Scalability**: Long-running workflows can be distributed across systems without losing progress.
* **Reliability**: Enables robust recovery from server restarts or failures.

## üèóÔ∏è How it Works

1. **Checkpointing** ‚Äì The graph‚Äôs state is saved at a pause point.
2. **External Event / Input** ‚Äì The system waits for a trigger (e.g., user input, external API callback).
3. **Resumption** ‚Äì When the event arrives, LangGraph reloads the saved state and continues execution.

## üìå Example: Patient Intake Workflow

Imagine a hospital‚Äôs digital assistant managing patient intake:

1. **Collect patient details** (symptoms, history).
2. **Pause** until lab results are available.
3. **Resume** once lab data arrives ‚Üí Diagnostic agent continues.
4. **Generate treatment plan**.

```python
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, END
from langgraph.checkpoint.memory import MemorySaver

# Define shared state
class State(dict): pass

# Nodes
def intake_node(state: State):
    state["patient"] = {"name": "John", "symptoms": "fever"}
    print("Patient intake complete. Waiting for lab results...")
    return state

def lab_results_node(state: State):
    # This simulates lab data arriving later
    state["lab_results"] = {"WBC": 12000, "CRP": "elevated"}
    print("Lab results received.")
    return state

def diagnosis_node(state: State):
    if state["lab_results"]["WBC"] > 10000:
        state["diagnosis"] = "Possible infection"
    print(f"Diagnosis: {state['diagnosis']}")
    return state

# Build Graph
graph = StateGraph(State)

graph.add_node("intake", intake_node)
graph.add_node("labs", lab_results_node)
graph.add_node("diagnosis", diagnosis_node)

graph.set_entry_point("intake")
graph.add_edge("intake", "labs")
graph.add_edge("labs", "diagnosis")
graph.add_edge("diagnosis", END)

# Attach memory for pause/resume
memory = MemorySaver()
app = graph.compile(checkpointer=memory)

# Run until pause point
state = app.invoke({}, {"configurable": {"thread_id": "patient123"}})

# Later... resume after lab results are ready
state = app.invoke(state, {"configurable": {"thread_id": "patient123"}})
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Key Considerations

* **Checkpointer Backends**:

  * In-memory (simple, temporary).
  * Redis, SQL, or cloud storage (persistent, scalable).
* **Events & Triggers**: Define what resumes the workflow (e.g., user action, webhook, cron job).
* **Timeouts & Fallbacks**: Handle cases where the workflow never resumes.
* **Multi-agent sync**: Useful when different agents must wait for each other‚Äôs results.

---

## üöë Healthcare Example

* **Diagnostic Agent** pauses until lab reports arrive.
* **Insurance Agent** pauses until claim approval.
* **Treatment Agent** resumes only when the patient confirms consent.

This makes LangGraph an excellent fit for **long-running medical, financial, or legal workflows** where pause/resume is the norm.

‚úÖ **Summary**:
Pause & Resume lets LangGraph support **stateful, real-world workflows** that persist across interruptions. With checkpointing and external triggers, you can build reliable systems that work at human timescales, not just machine speeds.
