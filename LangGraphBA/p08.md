# Chapter 8: Sequential Graphs

Sequential graphs are the simplest type of LangGraph workflow. They represent a **linear pipeline of execution** where each node passes its output directly to the next node in the sequence.

Think of it like a traditional assembly line:
**Node → Node → Node → … → Final Result**

This is useful when the workflow follows a **strict order** and every step depends on the result of the previous one.

## 🔑 Key Points

* **Linear flow**: No branching or parallelism.
* **Deterministic order**: Each node runs only after the previous one finishes.
* **Best suited for pipelines** like:

  * Data preprocessing → Transformation → Storage
  * Query → Search → Answer Generation
  * Input → LLM → Postprocessing → Output

## 🛠️ Implementation in LangGraph

Here’s a simple sequential workflow:

```python
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, END
from typing import Dict

# State definition
class GraphState(Dict):
    text: str

# Node 1: Clean text
def clean_text(state: GraphState) -> GraphState:
    state["text"] = state["text"].strip().lower()
    return state

# Node 2: Summarize
def summarize(state: GraphState) -> GraphState:
    state["text"] = f"Summary: {state['text'][:50]}..."
    return state

# Node 3: Store in file
def store_file(state: GraphState) -> GraphState:
    with open("output.txt", "w") as f:
        f.write(state["text"])
    return state

# Build the graph
workflow = StateGraph(GraphState)
workflow.add_node("clean_text", clean_text)
workflow.add_node("summarize", summarize)
workflow.add_node("store_file", store_file)

workflow.set_entry_point("clean_text")
workflow.add_edge("clean_text", "summarize")
workflow.add_edge("summarize", "store_file")
workflow.add_edge("store_file", END)

app = workflow.compile()

# Run
result = app.invoke({"text": "   This is an example of LangGraph Sequential Graphs!   "})
print(result)
```

## 📊 Example Flow

**Input → Clean text → Summarize → Store in file**

1. Input: `"   This is an example of LangGraph Sequential Graphs!   "`
2. Cleaned: `"this is an example of langgraph sequential graphs!"`
3. Summarized: `"Summary: this is an example of langgraph sequen..."`
4. Stored in `output.txt`.

## ✅ When to Use Sequential Graphs

* ETL pipelines (Extract → Transform → Load).
* Simple document workflows.
* Cases where there is **no branching condition**.
* To demonstrate basic LangGraph usage before moving to more complex workflows.
