# Chapter 3: Installation & Setup

In this chapter, weâ€™ll walk through how to install **LangGraph**, set up your development environment, and run your very first graph. By the end, youâ€™ll have a working **Hello World Graph** that demonstrates the basics of execution.

---

## 3.1 Environment Requirements

Before installing LangGraph, ensure that you have the following:

* **Python**: version 3.9 or higher (recommended 3.10 or 3.11).
* **pip**: Python package manager.
* **Virtual Environment (optional but recommended)**:
  Helps to isolate project dependencies.

```bash
# Create and activate a virtual environment (Linux/Mac)
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

# On Windows
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

---

## 3.2 Installing LangGraph

LangGraph is available on PyPI, so installation is straightforward:

```bash
pip install langgraph
```

You may also need **langchain** and an **LLM backend** (like OpenAI, Ollama, or Anthropic) depending on your project:

```bash
pip install langchain openai
```

---

## 3.3 Running Your First Graph

Letâ€™s create a simple **Hello World Graph** that demonstrates passing text through a node.

### Example: Hello World Graph

```python
# hello_world_graph.py

from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, END

# Define the state schema
class State(dict):
    pass

# Define a simple node
def hello_node(state: State) -> State:
    text = state.get("text", "")
    print("Node received:", text)
    state["text"] = f"Hello, {text}!"
    return state

# Build the graph
graph = StateGraph(State)

# Add node
graph.add_node("hello", hello_node)

# Add edges
graph.add_edge("hello", END)

# Compile the graph
app = graph.compile()

# Run the graph
if __name__ == "__main__":
    result = app.invoke({"text": "World"})
    print("Final Output:", result["text"])
```

---

### Expected Output

When you run the script:

```bash
python hello_world_graph.py
```

You should see:

```
Node received: World
Final Output: Hello, World!
```

---

## 3.4 Key Takeaways

* **LangGraph installation** is simple with `pip`.
* Always work inside a **virtual environment** for clean dependency management.
* A **graph** consists of nodes, edges, and state.
* The **Hello World Graph** shows how data flows through a node and returns modified output.

ðŸ‘‰ Next, in **Chapter 4**, weâ€™ll explore **State Management** in detail: how state evolves across nodes and how you can customize it.
