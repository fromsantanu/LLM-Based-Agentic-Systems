# **Chapter 1: Introduction & Setup**

## What is ChromaDB?

ChromaDB is an **open-source vector database** designed for storing, searching, and managing embeddings (vector representations of text, images, or other data). Unlike traditional relational databases, ChromaDB is optimized for high-dimensional similarity search, making it especially suitable for modern **AI and machine learning applications**.

Key features:

* **Embeddings-first**: Works directly with vector representations generated by models like OpenAI, HuggingFace, etc.
* **High-performance similarity search**: Finds items similar in meaning or context, not just exact matches.
* **Lightweight and developer-friendly**: Easy to set up locally and scalable to production.
* **Native Python integration**: Designed with Python users in mind, with a simple API.

## Use Cases of ChromaDB

ChromaDB is widely used in applications that require **semantic understanding** of data:

1. **AI & Large Language Models (LLMs)**

   * Enhancing LLMs with context retrieval (RAG – Retrieval Augmented Generation).
   * Example: Adding memory to chatbots by retrieving relevant past conversations.

2. **Semantic Search**

   * Instead of keyword matching, search by meaning.
   * Example: Finding research papers similar in topic, even if keywords differ.

3. **Recommendation Systems**

   * Suggest content (movies, products, music) based on similarity of embeddings.

4. **Clustering & Data Analysis**

   * Grouping similar documents, users, or items for deeper insights.

5. **Healthcare & Research** *(your domain)*

   * Organizing medical reports by similarity.
   * Retrieving case studies or guidelines relevant to patient symptoms.

## Installing ChromaDB

ChromaDB can be installed directly via **pip**.

```bash
pip install chromadb
```

If you also want support for persistent storage (SQLite/Postgres backend), you can install with:

```bash
pip install chromadb[postgres]
```

## Setting Up Python Environment

To avoid dependency conflicts, it’s a good practice to use a **virtual environment**. You can use either **venv** (built-in) or **Conda** (popular in data science).

### Option 1: Using `venv`

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv chroma-env  

# Activate environment
# On Windows:
chroma-env\Scripts\activate  
# On macOS/Linux:
source chroma-env/bin/activate  

# Install ChromaDB
pip install chromadb
```

### Option 2: Using Conda

```bash
# Create a conda environment
conda create -n chroma-env python=3.11 -y  

# Activate environment
conda activate chroma-env  

# Install ChromaDB
pip install chromadb
```

✅ At this stage, you have ChromaDB installed in a clean environment and ready for use.
In the next chapter, we’ll cover how to **create a database, collections, and insert documents**.
