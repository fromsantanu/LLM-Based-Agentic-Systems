# **Understanding how LLMs (Large Language Models) work**

---

## 1. [Foundations of LLMs](https://github.com/fromsantanu/LLM-Based-Agentic-Systems/blob/main/LLM/p1.md)

* What is a Large Language Model (LLM)?
* History of language models (n-grams → RNNs → LSTMs → Transformers)
* Basics of neural networks and deep learning
* Introduction to the Transformer architecture
* Attention mechanism (Self-Attention, Multi-Head Attention)
* Tokenization and subword models (BPE, WordPiece, SentencePiece)

---

## 2. Training and Optimization

* Pretraining on massive text corpora
* Objectives: Next Token Prediction vs Masked Language Modeling
* Fine-tuning vs Pretraining
* Instruction tuning and Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)
* Scaling laws for LLMs (parameters, data, compute)
* Alignment: safety, bias reduction, and guardrails

---

## 3. Core Capabilities

* Text generation (next-word prediction)
* Summarization and paraphrasing
* Question answering
* Reasoning and chain-of-thought prompting
* Code generation and debugging
* Multi-lingual capabilities and translation

---

## 4. Prompting and Interaction

* Zero-shot, one-shot, and few-shot prompting
* Prompt engineering basics
* Role of system prompts and instructions
* Context windows and memory limitations
* Tools for prompt optimization (e.g., LangChain, guidance, DSPy)

---

## 5. Using LLMs in Applications

* Chatbots and conversational agents
* Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with vector databases
* Knowledge base assistants and semantic search
* Document processing (summarization, extraction, classification)
* Code assistants (e.g., Copilot-style tools)
* Healthcare, finance, education use cases
* Workflow automation with agents (LangChain, N8N)

---

## 6. Evaluation and Performance

* Perplexity and accuracy metrics
* Benchmarks: MMLU, BIG-bench, HumanEval
* Hallucinations and factuality challenges
* Evaluating bias and fairness
* Efficiency: quantization, pruning, distillation

---

## 7. Infrastructure and Deployment

* Running LLMs locally vs via API
* Cloud platforms (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, HuggingFace)
* Model serving with FastAPI, Flask, or Streamlit
* Hardware needs: GPU vs CPU vs TPU
* Cost optimization and batching strategies

---

## 8. Advanced Topics

* Multimodal LLMs (text + image + audio + video)
* Fine-tuning with LoRA and PEFT methods
* Self-reflection and self-correction in LLMs
* Multi-agent systems and orchestration
* Integration with external tools and APIs
* Security: prompt injection, data leakage, adversarial inputs

---

## 9. Societal and Ethical Considerations

* AI alignment and safety concerns
* Bias, fairness, and representation in training data
* Privacy and security (PII handling, GDPR/HIPAA issues)
* Responsible AI guidelines
* Economic and social impact of LLMs on jobs and industries

---

## 10. Future of LLMs

* Trends in scaling and efficiency (smaller but smarter models)
* Specialized domain LLMs (legal, medical, scientific)
* Agentic AI and autonomous workflows
* Integration with robotics and IoT
* Open-source vs proprietary ecosystems
* The role of LLMs in shaping future knowledge and society
