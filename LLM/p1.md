# 1. Foundations of LLMs

## What is a Large Language Model (LLM)?

A **Large Language Model (LLM)** is an advanced type of artificial intelligence system designed to understand and generate human-like text. LLMs are trained on massive datasets of text and code, enabling them to:

* Predict the next word in a sequence (language modeling).
* Answer questions, summarize text, translate languages, or even generate creative writing.
* Adapt to many tasks without task-specific training (few-shot and zero-shot learning).

Key features of LLMs:

* **Scale**: Billions or even trillions of parameters.
* **Generalization**: Ability to perform multiple tasks with the same model.
* **Contextual understanding**: Generate coherent, context-aware responses.

## History of Language Models

The evolution of language models reflects decades of research and increasing computational power:

1. **N-grams (1980s–1990s)**

   * Statistical models that predicted a word based on the previous *n–1* words.
   * Example: A trigram model predicts “dog” in “The black \_\_\_” by analyzing frequency counts.
   * Limitation: Poor performance on long contexts and large vocabularies.

2. **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) (2000s)**

   * Introduced the use of neural networks for sequences.
   * Could handle longer contexts compared to n-grams.
   * Limitation: Struggled with long-term dependencies due to vanishing gradients.

3. **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and GRUs (2010s)**

   * Improved over RNNs by introducing gating mechanisms.
   * Capable of modeling longer dependencies in sequences.
   * Widely used in early machine translation and speech recognition.

4. **Transformers (2017–present)**

   * Introduced in the paper *“Attention Is All You Need”* (Vaswani et al., 2017).
   * Removed recurrence and convolution, relying purely on **attention mechanisms**.
   * Enabled massive parallelization and scaling → foundation for modern LLMs like GPT, BERT, LLaMA, etc.

## Basics of Neural Networks and Deep Learning

To understand LLMs, a refresher on neural networks helps:

* **Neurons**: Basic units performing weighted sums followed by non-linear activation (e.g., ReLU).
* **Layers**: Networks stack layers (input → hidden → output) to learn complex patterns.
* **Training**: Models learn by minimizing loss using optimization (e.g., stochastic gradient descent).
* **Deep Learning**: Stacking many layers allows hierarchical feature extraction.

Language models treat **text as data**, converting words into numeric vectors and training networks to predict and generate sequences.

## Introduction to the Transformer Architecture

Transformers changed the landscape of NLP. Core components:

1. **Encoder–Decoder structure** (original Transformer):

   * **Encoder**: Processes input sequence.
   * **Decoder**: Generates output sequence.
2. Modern LLMs (like GPT) often use only the **decoder** part.
3. Transformers rely on **attention** instead of recurrence to capture dependencies between tokens.

Advantages:

* Parallel training (no sequential bottleneck of RNNs).
* Handles long-range dependencies better.
* Scales effectively with larger data and parameters.

## Attention Mechanism

At the heart of Transformers lies **attention**.

1. **Self-Attention**

   * Each word in a sentence attends to every other word.
   * Example: In “The cat sat on the mat,” the model can link “cat” with “sat” directly.

2. **Multi-Head Attention**

   * Uses multiple attention “heads” to learn different types of relationships simultaneously.
   * Example: One head might track subject–verb agreement, while another tracks semantic context.

Mathematically, attention scores are computed using:

$$
\text{Attention}(Q,K,V) = \text{softmax}\left(\frac{QK^T}{\sqrt{d_k}}\right)V
$$

where **Q** = Query, **K** = Key, **V** = Value matrices derived from input embeddings.

## Tokenization and Subword Models

LLMs process **tokens**, not raw characters or full words. Tokenization splits text into meaningful units:

1. **Word-level tokenization**

   * Simple but inefficient (large vocabulary, poor handling of rare words).

2. **Subword models**

   * **Byte Pair Encoding (BPE)**: Iteratively merges frequent character pairs.
   * **WordPiece**: Similar to BPE but uses likelihood optimization.
   * **SentencePiece**: Language-agnostic, works directly with raw text and whitespace.

Advantages:

* Handles rare words by breaking them into subwords (e.g., “unhappiness” → “un”, “happiness”).
* Keeps vocabulary size manageable.
* Works well across languages.

✅ **Summary:**
This chapter covered the foundations of LLMs: what they are, their history, neural network basics, the Transformer architecture, attention mechanisms, and tokenization strategies. These concepts form the backbone for understanding how today’s powerful language models are built and how they function.
