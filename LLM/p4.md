# 4. Prompting and Interaction

Large Language Models (LLMs) are highly sensitive to the way they are prompted. The design and structure of prompts directly affect the quality, accuracy, and relevance of their outputs. This chapter introduces the key prompting strategies, the basics of prompt engineering, the role of system prompts, and important considerations like context windows and memory limitations. It also highlights tools that help optimize and automate the prompting process.

## 4.1 Zero-Shot, One-Shot, and Few-Shot Prompting

LLMs learn general patterns from massive text corpora during pretraining. By carefully designing inputs, we can leverage this knowledge without needing to retrain the model.

* **Zero-Shot Prompting**
  The model is asked to perform a task without any examples, relying solely on instructions.
  *Example:*
  *“Translate the following sentence into French: ‘The weather is nice today.’”*

* **One-Shot Prompting**
  A single example is provided to demonstrate the desired task format or style.
  *Example:*
  *“Translate into French. Example: ‘The cat is sleeping.’ → ‘Le chat dort.’ Now translate: ‘The weather is nice today.’”*

* **Few-Shot Prompting**
  Multiple examples are given to guide the model toward consistent performance.
  *Example:*

  ```
  English: The dog runs.
  French: Le chien court.

  English: She is reading a book.
  French: Elle lit un livre.

  English: The weather is nice today.
  French:
  ```

Few-shot prompting is particularly powerful when tasks are ambiguous or require a specific output format.

## 4.2 Prompt Engineering Basics

Prompt engineering is the art of crafting prompts to guide LLMs toward better results. Core principles include:

1. **Clarity and Specificity** – Use explicit instructions rather than vague requests.
   *“Summarize this article in three bullet points”* is better than *“Summarize this article.”*

2. **Role Assignment** – Giving the model a persona can improve relevance.
   *“You are an expert Python tutor. Explain recursion with a simple example.”*

3. **Step-by-Step Instructions** – Encourage reasoning through chain-of-thought.
   *“Solve the problem step by step before giving the final answer.”*

4. **Output Formatting** – Specify the structure you want.
   *“Return the answer as a JSON object with fields ‘summary’ and ‘keywords.’”*

5. **Iterative Refinement** – Break complex tasks into smaller prompts, feeding outputs back into new prompts.

## 4.3 Role of System Prompts and Instructions

In many LLM interfaces, prompts can be layered:

* **System Prompt** – Defines global behavior and rules (e.g., “You are a helpful assistant.”).
* **User Prompt** – The actual query or request.
* **Assistant Responses** – The generated outputs.

System prompts act like high-level guidelines, ensuring consistency and compliance across all interactions. For example, in ChatGPT, the system prompt ensures that the assistant maintains a helpful and safe tone. Developers can further refine system prompts to specialize the model (e.g., for medical Q\&A, coding support, or customer service).

## 4.4 Context Windows and Memory Limitations

LLMs process input within a fixed **context window** (measured in tokens). This includes both the user’s input and the model’s prior responses.

* **Smaller context windows** (e.g., 2k–4k tokens) mean the model quickly forgets earlier interactions.
* **Larger context windows** (e.g., 32k–200k tokens in newer models) allow longer conversations, entire documents, or multi-step reasoning to fit.

**Limitations:**

* Once the limit is exceeded, the oldest parts of the conversation are truncated.
* The model does not have true “memory”; it only sees what fits into the context window.
* Long contexts may increase computational cost and response latency.

**Solutions:**
Developers often integrate **external memory systems** (vector databases like ChromaDB, Pinecone, or Qdrant) to store and retrieve relevant information dynamically.

## 4.5 Tools for Prompt Optimization

A growing ecosystem of tools helps optimize prompt design, testing, and orchestration:

* **LangChain** – Provides prompt templates, chaining of LLM calls, memory management, and integration with external APIs.
* **Guidance** – A framework for controlling model outputs using templates and constraints.
* **DSPy** – A declarative framework that optimizes prompts automatically through *program synthesis* and gradient-based learning.
* **Prompt libraries** (e.g., PromptHub, FlowGPT) – Share and reuse effective prompts.
* **Experimentation Platforms** (e.g., Weights & Biases, OpenAI evals) – Allow benchmarking different prompts and measuring performance.

These tools allow practitioners to move beyond ad-hoc prompting toward systematic, testable, and scalable solutions.
