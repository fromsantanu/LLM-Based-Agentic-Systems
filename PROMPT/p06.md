# 6. **Domain-Specific Prompting**

Prompt engineering becomes most powerful when tailored to the specific domain in which a Large Language Model (LLM) is being applied. Different domains demand unique ways of framing tasks, setting context, and structuring outputs. In this chapter, we explore how prompts can be crafted for **data science and analytics, healthcare and research, education and tutoring, creative writing, and software development.**

## Prompts for Data Science & Analytics

Data science workflows require accuracy, reproducibility, and clarity. Prompts in this domain should emphasize structured outputs (tables, code blocks, JSON) and well-documented reasoning.

**Examples:**

* *Data Analysis:*
  “You are a data scientist. Given this dataset description, suggest the best statistical tests to compare group differences. Output a short explanation and R code example.”

* *Visualization:*
  “Generate Python code using Matplotlib to create a line chart of sales over time. Include axis labels, title, and gridlines.”

* *Interpretation:*
  “Explain the results of a linear regression model in plain language, suitable for a business executive.”

**Best practices:**

* Request step-by-step explanations for reproducibility.
* Specify the programming language and libraries.
* Use delimiters for datasets, formulas, or SQL queries.

## Prompts for Healthcare and Research

Healthcare and scientific research contexts require precision, sensitivity, and ethical framing. Prompts often involve summarizing clinical findings, interpreting data, or generating educational content for patients and practitioners.

**Examples:**

* *Clinical Summarization:*
  “Summarize this patient case note into a structured SOAP (Subjective, Objective, Assessment, Plan) format.”

* *Research Interpretation:*
  “Explain this medical trial’s findings for a non-specialist audience in under 200 words.”

* *Guideline Reference:*
  “Provide the latest WHO recommendations on tuberculosis treatment in a structured bullet-point format.”

**Best practices:**

* Always include disclaimers when discussing medical treatment.
* Request structured outputs (SOAP notes, bullet points, abstracts).
* Ensure clarity for both expert and lay audiences.

## Prompts for Education and Tutoring

In education, prompts should focus on scaffolding learning—breaking down complex topics, generating practice exercises, and adapting explanations to the learner’s level.

**Examples:**

* *Concept Explanation:*
  “Explain Newton’s three laws of motion as if teaching a high school student, with simple examples.”

* *Practice Problems:*
  “Create five math problems on quadratic equations with increasing difficulty, and provide step-by-step solutions.”

* *Adaptive Tutoring:*
  “Explain photosynthesis in three levels: beginner, intermediate, and advanced, using progressively more technical detail.”

**Best practices:**

* Ask the model to adapt tone and difficulty level.
* Use prompts that encourage interactivity (questions, quizzes).
* Include structured formats (numbered steps, multiple-choice).

## Prompts for Creative Writing & Storytelling

Creative domains require prompts that encourage originality, style variation, and imagination. The key is to balance guidance with freedom.

**Examples:**

* *Story Generation:*
  “Write a short story in the style of magical realism, featuring a character who discovers time slows down whenever they laugh.”

* *Brainstorming:*
  “Generate 10 unique plot twists for a detective novel set in 19th-century London.”

* *Stylistic Variation:*
  “Rewrite this paragraph in the style of Ernest Hemingway.”

**Best practices:**

* Use role assignments (“Act as a poet/novelist/screenwriter”).
* Include stylistic or genre constraints.
* Allow for iteration: first brainstorming, then expansion.

## Prompts for Coding & Debugging

Software development prompts benefit from clear instructions, error reproduction, and structured code outputs.

**Examples:**

* *Code Generation:*
  “Write a Python function that removes duplicates from a list while preserving order. Provide inline comments.”

* *Debugging:*
  “Here’s a Python error message. Diagnose the cause and suggest a corrected version of the code.”

* *Documentation:*
  “Generate docstrings and usage examples for this JavaScript function.”

**Best practices:**

* Provide context: language, framework, input/output.
* Request explanations alongside code for learning.
* Ask for modular, reusable snippets.

## Key Takeaways

* Domain-specific prompting tailors the LLM’s output to meet the standards, expectations, and workflows of a given field.
* **Data science** prompts benefit from structure and reproducibility.
* **Healthcare and research** prompts require accuracy and ethical disclaimers.
* **Education** prompts should focus on progressive learning and adaptability.
* **Creative writing** prompts should balance constraints with imaginative freedom.
* **Coding and debugging** prompts work best with explicit context and structured outputs.

By mastering domain-specific prompting, users can unlock the true potential of LLMs in specialized tasks—whether analyzing datasets, summarizing research, tutoring students, writing stories, or debugging code.
