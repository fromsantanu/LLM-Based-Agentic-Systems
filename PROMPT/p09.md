# 9. **Tool-Augmented Prompting**

Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful on their own, but their capabilities expand dramatically when combined with **APIs, external tools, and workflow orchestration frameworks**. Tool-augmented prompting is the practice of designing prompts that not only guide the model’s reasoning but also instruct it to **call tools, retrieve data, or execute actions** beyond its internal knowledge.

This chapter introduces the principles of tool-augmented prompting and explores how to combine ChatGPT with APIs, function calling, and workflow engines like LangChain or N8N.

## Prompting with APIs and External Tools

LLMs cannot directly access real-time or proprietary data unless they are connected to an API or tool. Tool-augmented prompts define **when and how** the model should delegate tasks externally.

Examples:

* Weather forecasts → Call a weather API when a user asks about tomorrow’s temperature.
* Stock prices → Query a financial data API.
* File analysis → Send uploaded documents to a parser or database before generating insights.

A typical prompt design includes:

1. **Triggering condition**: “If the user asks for real-time data, call the weather API.”
2. **Schema guidance**: Provide input/output format for the API.
3. **Fallback behavior**: If the tool call fails, the model should gracefully decline or approximate.

## Using Function Calling with ChatGPT

Function calling is a structured way to let LLMs call external functions. Instead of producing plain text, the model generates **JSON-structured arguments** that can be parsed by your application and executed.

**Example Workflow:**

1. Define a function (e.g., `get_weather(location, date)`).
2. Expose its schema to the LLM inside the prompt.
3. When the user asks, “What’s the weather in Delhi tomorrow?”, the LLM outputs structured JSON.

   ```json
   {
     "name": "get_weather",
     "arguments": {
       "location": "Delhi",
       "date": "2025-09-19"
     }
   }
   ```
4. The host application executes the function and passes results back to the model for a natural response.

This method ensures accuracy, reduces hallucination, and enables deterministic tool use.

## Integrating Prompts in Workflows (LangChain, N8N, etc.)

Frameworks like **LangChain**, **LlamaIndex**, and workflow orchestrators like **N8N** or **Zapier** allow chaining multiple prompts and tools into pipelines.

**Use cases:**

* **Healthcare assistant**: Patient question → Symptom extractor (prompt) → API call to knowledge base → Summarized treatment advice.
* **Business automation**: Customer email → Sentiment analysis → CRM update → Personalized reply.
* **Research agent**: Query → Web search tool → Document parser → Summarized insights → Visualization.

Design principles:

* **Decompose tasks** into modular prompts and tool calls.
* **Control state and memory** so results flow correctly between steps.
* **Error handling** to retry or rephrase prompts if tools fail.

## Hybrid Prompts (Text + Code + External Data)

Hybrid prompting combines **natural language instructions**, **code execution**, and **external data retrieval** in a single pipeline.

Example hybrid flow:

1. User: “Plot COVID-19 cases in India for the last 3 months.”
2. LLM prompt:

   * Generate Python code for API request to a COVID dataset.
   * Execute code to fetch data.
   * Use Matplotlib to plot graph.
3. LLM response: “Here’s the chart of COVID-19 trends in India.”

This approach creates **multi-modal agents** capable of reasoning, fetching, computing, and presenting results in rich formats.

## Key Takeaways

* Tool-augmented prompting transforms an LLM from a static responder into a **dynamic agent**.
* **APIs and function calls** extend the LLM’s reach to real-time and specialized knowledge.
* **Workflow orchestration** (LangChain, N8N) allows chaining prompts and tools into complete applications.
* **Hybrid prompts** combine natural language, code, and external data for powerful results.

In short, tool-augmented prompting shifts LLMs from being **knowledge containers** to becoming **knowledge orchestrators**, enabling real-world, end-to-end solutions.
