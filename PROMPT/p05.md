# 5. **Prompt Patterns & Frameworks**

Prompt patterns and frameworks provide structured approaches to designing effective prompts. By organizing instructions into reusable templates, they help reduce ambiguity, improve response quality, and ensure consistency. This chapter explores widely used frameworks such as **RTF**, **ICE**, persona-based prompting, and formatting with delimiters.

## Role-Task-Format (RTF) Pattern

The **RTF pattern** is one of the simplest and most effective ways to design a prompt. It breaks down the request into three key elements:

* **Role** – Assign a perspective or expertise to the model.
* **Task** – Specify what needs to be done.
* **Format** – Define the expected structure of the output.

**Example:**

```
Role: You are an experienced data scientist.  
Task: Explain logistic regression to a beginner.  
Format: Provide a short paragraph explanation followed by a simple bullet-point example.
```

**Benefits:**

* Makes prompts clear and modular.
* Encourages consistency across tasks.
* Easy to adapt for different domains (education, business, coding).

## Instruction + Context + Example (ICE) Pattern

The **ICE pattern** improves reliability by combining instructions with background context and concrete examples.

* **Instruction** – What the model should do.
* **Context** – Relevant information that grounds the response.
* **Example** – A sample response that demonstrates the expected style.

**Example:**

```
Instruction: Summarize the given research article in plain English.  
Context: The article discusses the impact of air pollution on lung health.  
Example: "This study shows that long-term exposure to polluted air increases the risk of chronic lung diseases, especially in children and elderly people."
```

**Benefits:**

* Reduces ambiguity in interpretation.
* Anchors the model’s response in domain knowledge.
* Ensures style and tone match user expectations.

## Persona-Based Prompting

Assigning a **persona** helps shape the tone, perspective, and expertise of responses. A persona can be as general as “a friendly teacher” or as specific as “a cybersecurity consultant with 20 years of experience.”

**Examples:**

* *“Act as a motivational coach and help me create a daily routine.”*
* *“You are a historian specializing in World War II. Explain the causes of the conflict in detail.”*

**Use cases:**

* Customer support bots adopting polite, empathetic personas.
* Educational tutors simulating expert teachers.
* Creative writing where characters narrate in specific voices.

**Benefits:**

* Increases relatability and engagement.
* Helps the model align with domain-specific expectations.
* Makes role-play and simulations more realistic.

## Delimiters and Structured Formatting

Large language models often need **delimiters** (markers like quotes, code blocks, or symbols) to clearly separate instructions, inputs, and outputs. Structured formatting (JSON, Markdown, tables) helps ensure machine-readable or human-friendly responses.

**Common Delimiters:**

* Triple backticks (\`\`\`) for code or text blocks.
* XML/HTML-like tags (`<task>...</task>`).
* Markdown headings, bullet lists, or tables.

**Examples:**

1. **JSON format output**

```
{
  "title": "AI in Healthcare",
  "summary": "AI is being used for early disease detection, personalized medicine, and workflow automation."
}
```

2. **Markdown response**

```
### Key Benefits of Meditation
- Reduces stress
- Improves focus
- Enhances emotional well-being
```

3. **Table format**
   \| Method              | Use Case             | Example Output Style      |
   \|---------------------|----------------------|---------------------------|
   \| JSON                | APIs, data exchange | Structured key-value pairs|
   \| Markdown            | Reports, docs       | Headings, bullet points   |
   \| Table (CSV/Markdown)| Comparisons         | Tabular summaries         |

**Benefits:**

* Improves readability and reusability.
* Facilitates direct integration with apps, APIs, or dashboards.
* Reduces errors from ambiguous free-text outputs.

✅ **Key Takeaway:** Prompt patterns like **RTF**, **ICE**, persona-based prompting, and structured formatting are powerful tools that transform vague instructions into precise, high-quality responses.
