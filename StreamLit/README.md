# ðŸ“˜ Topics to Introduce Streamlit in the Context of Agentic Systems

### [1. **Introduction to Streamlit**](#)

* What is Streamlit and why it is popular for rapid prototyping?
* Why it is suitable for **Agentic Systems** (interactive UI for agents, low-code dashboarding, easy deployment).
* **Example**: Build a simple *"Hello Agent!"* app where a user can type a query, and the app forwards it to a placeholder agent function.

---

### [2. **Streamlit Basics for Agent Interaction**](#)

* Widgets: `st.text_input`, `st.button`, `st.selectbox`, `st.chat_message`.
* Handling input/output flows.
* **Example**: Create a chat-like UI where a user asks a symptom-related question, and a dummy *Triage Agent* responds with a canned answer.

---

### [3. **Building a Multi-Agent Dashboard**](#)

* Layout management: columns, tabs, sidebars.
* Displaying multiple agentsâ€™ outputs side by side.
* **Example**: Show outputs from a *Diagnostic Agent*, *Translator Agent*, and *Queue Manager Agent* in separate tabs.

---

### [4. **Connecting Streamlit with LangChain / LangGraph Agents**](#)

* Integrating Streamlit front-end with agent back-ends.
* Sending queries to agents and showing structured results.
* **Example**: Connect Streamlit to a LangGraph pipeline that simulates a *Test Order Placer Agent* and displays the ordered lab tests.

---

### [5. **Form Handling and Validation for Agent Inputs**](#)

* Using forms (`st.form`) for structured data capture.
* Validating patient inputs before passing to agents.
* **Example**: Create a *Patient Intake Form* where fields like age, symptoms, allergies are captured and validated before being sent to the *Triage Agent*.

---

### [6. **Visualizing Agent Outputs**](#)

* Using `st.metric`, `st.progress`, `st.bar_chart`, `st.dataframe`.
* Presenting agentsâ€™ recommendations or analytics clearly.
* **Example**: A *Recovery Monitoring Agent* that plots daily temperature and blood pressure readings.

---

### [7. **Session State for Multi-Step Agent Workflows**](#)

* How to maintain conversation context.
* Storing intermediate agent decisions.
* **Example**: Track a multi-step *Diagnostic Agent* conversation (symptom â†’ test â†’ treatment suggestion) across multiple user inputs.

---

### [8. **File Uploads & Reports**](#)

* Handling `st.file_uploader` for lab reports or imaging data.
* Agents parsing uploaded files.
* **Example**: Upload a blood test CSV â†’ *Diagnostic Agent* analyzes it â†’ Streamlit shows summary + recommendations.

---

### [9. **Streaming Responses for Realistic Agent Interaction**](#)

* Using `st.write_stream` for token-by-token streaming.
* Making agents appear more natural.
* **Example**: A *Translator Agent* that streams the translation of a medical instruction line by line.

---

### [10. **Deployment & Sharing of Agentic Apps**](#)

* Deploying with **Streamlit Cloud**, Docker, or FastAPI hybrid setups.
* Scaling for production.
* **Example**: Deploy a demo *Hospital Queue Management Agentic App* where patients register and agents assign them to doctors.

---

ðŸ‘‰ This structure starts from **Streamlit basics** and gradually shows how it becomes the **front-end engine for Agentic Systems** (triage, diagnostics, monitoring, multi-agent orchestration).
