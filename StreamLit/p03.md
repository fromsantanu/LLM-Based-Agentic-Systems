# Chapter 3 : Building a Multi-Agent Dashboard

## Building a Multi-Agent Dashboard

In real-world agentic applications, you often need to display and manage outputs from **multiple agents simultaneously**. For example, a healthcare application might include:

* A **Diagnostic Agent** that analyzes patient symptoms.
* A **Translator Agent** that converts technical medical terminology into patient-friendly language.
* A **Queue Manager Agent** that organizes requests and ensures compliance.

To make this interaction smooth, Streamlit provides **layout management features** such as **columns, tabs, and sidebars**, which allow you to arrange multiple agent outputs in an intuitive way.

### Layout Management in Streamlit

1. **Columns (`st.columns`)**

   * Split the screen into horizontal sections.
   * Useful for comparing agent outputs side by side.

   ```python
   col1, col2 = st.columns(2)
   with col1:
       st.subheader("Diagnostic Agent")
       st.write("Patient shows signs of mild infection.")
   with col2:
       st.subheader("Translator Agent")
       st.write("Layman version: You might just have a common infection.")
   ```

2. **Tabs (`st.tabs`)**

   * Provide a clean way to separate multiple agents’ outputs without clutter.
   * Useful when you have 3–5 agents and want users to focus on one at a time.

   ```python
   tab1, tab2, tab3 = st.tabs(["Diagnostic Agent", "Translator Agent", "Queue Manager Agent"])

   with tab1:
       st.write("Diagnostic Agent: Preliminary diagnosis suggests a viral infection.")
   with tab2:
       st.write("Translator Agent: This means you may have caught a viral fever.")
   with tab3:
       st.write("Queue Manager Agent: Your case is added to the doctor’s queue.")
   ```

3. **Sidebar (`st.sidebar`)**

   * Ideal for global controls (e.g., agent selection, configuration settings, filters).

   ```python
   st.sidebar.title("Agent Controls")
   selected_agent = st.sidebar.selectbox(
       "Choose Agent", ["Diagnostic Agent", "Translator Agent", "Queue Manager Agent"]
   )
   st.sidebar.write(f"Currently viewing: {selected_agent}")
   ```

### Example: Multi-Agent Dashboard with Tabs

Below is a **full example** showing how you can set up a dashboard where three agents’ outputs are displayed in separate tabs:

```python
import streamlit as st

st.title("Multi-Agent Dashboard")

# Sidebar for configuration
st.sidebar.header("Agent Configuration")
patient_id = st.sidebar.text_input("Enter Patient ID", "P001")

tab1, tab2, tab3 = st.tabs(["Diagnostic Agent", "Translator Agent", "Queue Manager Agent"])

with tab1:
    st.subheader("Diagnostic Agent Output")
    st.write(f"Patient {patient_id}: Preliminary diagnosis suggests a mild viral infection.")

with tab2:
    st.subheader("Translator Agent Output")
    st.write(f"Patient {patient_id}: You may just have a common viral fever, nothing severe.")

with tab3:
    st.subheader("Queue Manager Agent Output")
    st.write(f"Patient {patient_id} has been added to the consultation queue. Expected wait: 15 minutes.")
```
