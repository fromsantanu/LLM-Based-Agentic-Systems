# Chapter 10: Deployment & Sharing of Agentic Apps

Once you‚Äôve built and tested your agentic system locally, the next step is to make it available for others to use. Deployment is about moving from the ‚Äúdeveloper‚Äôs machine‚Äù to a **shareable, scalable environment**‚Äîwhether for demo purposes, small-group pilots, or production-scale apps.

---

## 10.1 Deployment Options for Agentic Apps

Streamlit offers several approaches to deployment depending on your needs:

### 1. **Streamlit Cloud (Simplest Option)**

* Hosted directly on [Streamlit Community Cloud](https://streamlit.io/cloud).
* Free for small projects, with easy GitHub integration.
* Pros: One-click deploy, automatic updates when pushing to GitHub.
* Cons: Limited resources, not suitable for heavy production workloads.

**Steps:**

1. Push your project folder to GitHub.
2. Log into Streamlit Cloud and connect your repo.
3. Configure dependencies via `requirements.txt`.
4. Click **Deploy**.

---

### 2. **Docker Deployment (For Portability)**

* Package your app with all dependencies into a Docker image.
* Run on any cloud provider (AWS, GCP, Azure, DigitalOcean).
* Pros: Reproducible, portable, suitable for team deployments.
* Cons: Requires some DevOps setup.

**Dockerfile Example:**

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.11-slim

WORKDIR /app

COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt

COPY . .

EXPOSE 8501

CMD ["streamlit", "run", "app.py", "--server.port=8501", "--server.address=0.0.0.0"]
```

Build and run:

```bash
docker build -t hospital-agentic-app .
docker run -p 8501:8501 hospital-agentic-app
```

---

### 3. **FastAPI + Streamlit Hybrid (Advanced Option)**

* Use **FastAPI** as the backend (for APIs, authentication, database ops).
* Use **Streamlit** as the front-end dashboard.
* Pros: Best for production-ready, modular apps.
* Cons: Requires backend/frontend integration.

**Typical Setup:**

* FastAPI handles:

  * Patient registration database (Postgres/MySQL).
  * Agent workflows exposed via REST endpoints.
* Streamlit:

  * Frontend UI for patients and doctors.
  * Calls FastAPI endpoints to fetch results.

## 10.2 Scaling for Production

When deploying agentic apps for hospitals, research labs, or businesses:

* **Concurrency**: Use load balancers (NGINX, Traefik) to handle multiple users.
* **Caching**: Use Redis or Streamlit‚Äôs `@st.cache_data` for expensive computations.
* **Database**: Move from CSV/SQLite to production databases (Postgres, MongoDB).
* **Monitoring**: Track latency, errors, and uptime with tools like Grafana or LangFuse.

---

## 10.3 Example: Hospital Queue Management Agentic App

Let‚Äôs consider a **demo hospital queue system** where patients register and agents assign them to doctors.

### Patient Flow

1. Patient fills registration form (`st.form`).
2. Data sent to **Queue Management Agent**.
3. Agent assigns doctor based on:

   * Specialty
   * Current load
   * Urgency level
4. Queue status shown in real time.

### Streamlit Frontend (Simplified)

```python
import streamlit as st
import random

# Simulated doctor queue
doctors = {"Dr. Sharma (Cardiology)": 0, "Dr. Sen (General)": 0, "Dr. Rao (Pediatrics)": 0}

st.title("üè• Hospital Queue Management Agent")

with st.form("registration_form"):
    name = st.text_input("Patient Name")
    age = st.number_input("Age", 0, 120, 30)
    dept = st.selectbox("Required Department", list(doctors.keys()))
    submitted = st.form_submit_button("Register")

if submitted:
    # Assign doctor (simple agent logic: least busy)
    assigned_doctor = min(doctors, key=doctors.get)
    doctors[assigned_doctor] += 1
    st.success(f"‚úÖ {name} assigned to {assigned_doctor}")

st.subheader("üìä Current Queue Status")
st.table(doctors.items())
```

## 10.4 Deployment Strategy for This Example

* **Demo / Student Project** ‚Üí Deploy directly on Streamlit Cloud.
* **Hospital Pilot** ‚Üí Use Docker + PostgreSQL for persistence.
* **Production-Scale Hospital Network** ‚Üí Hybrid setup with FastAPI backend, Streamlit front-end, load balancers, and monitoring.

---

## ‚úÖ Key Takeaways

* Streamlit Cloud is great for quick demos.
* Docker makes apps portable and reproducible.
* FastAPI + Streamlit hybrid setups prepare apps for serious production.
* Scaling requires concurrency management, caching, and monitoring.
* Example: Hospital Queue Management Agent demonstrates real-world deployment of agentic systems.
