# 📘 Chapter 4: Installing Supabase Locally (Docker Based)

This chapter explains **local Supabase** — something very important for:

* Learning safely
* Testing without internet
* Keeping sensitive data on your own computer

I will explain everything **slowly and simply**, with real-life examples.

---

## 1️⃣ What “Local Supabase” Means

Normally, when you create a Supabase project:

* Your database runs on Supabase servers (cloud)
* You need internet all the time

### Local Supabase means:

👉 **Supabase runs on your own computer**

* Database runs locally
* Auth runs locally
* APIs run locally
* Nothing goes to the internet unless you want it

📌 **Simple analogy**

* Cloud Supabase → rented office in another city
* Local Supabase → office inside your own house

Both work the **same way**, only the location is different.

---

## 2️⃣ Why Use Supabase Locally?

Local Supabase is very useful when:

✅ You are learning Supabase
✅ You want to experiment freely
✅ You are working with private data
✅ You want fast testing
✅ You want to avoid accidental cloud costs

📌 **Teacher’s perspective**
Local Supabase is like a **practice laboratory** where mistakes are safe.

---

## 3️⃣ Installing Prerequisites (One-Time Setup)

To run Supabase locally, you need **two tools**.

---

### 🐳 Docker

*(The engine that runs Supabase services)*

Supabase local setup uses **Docker**.

📌 What Docker does (very simple):

* It runs many small services
* Each service is isolated
* Everything starts and stops cleanly

👉 Think of Docker as:

* A **machine that runs ready-made appliances**
* Each appliance is one Supabase service

You need:

* **Docker Desktop** installed and running

⚠️ Important:

* Docker must be **running before** Supabase starts

---

### 🛠️ Supabase CLI

*(The remote control)*

Supabase provides a command-line tool called **Supabase CLI**.

📌 What CLI does:

* Starts Supabase
* Stops Supabase
* Manages database
* Resets everything safely

👉 Analogy:
CLI is like a **remote control** for your local Supabase office.

---

## 4️⃣ Starting Supabase Locally

Once Docker and CLI are ready:

1. Open a project folder on your computer
2. Initialize Supabase
3. Start Supabase

When you start Supabase:

* Docker downloads required images
* Multiple services start together
* Local backend becomes available

📌 First start takes time
Later starts are much faster.

---

## 5️⃣ Understanding Local Supabase Services

When Supabase runs locally, **multiple services start together**.

Let’s understand them one by one.

---

### 🗄️ Local Database

*(PostgreSQL on your machine)*

* A full **PostgreSQL** database
* Stores:

  * Your tables
  * Your data
  * Auth information
* Data stays on your computer

📌 Like a **personal filing cabinet** under your desk.

---

### 🔐 Local Authentication

*(Login system)*

* Handles sign-up and login
* Stores users locally
* Issues local access tokens

📌 Even without internet:

* Login works
* Permissions work

👉 This is extremely useful for testing security rules.

---

### 🔌 Local API Endpoints

*(Local reception desk)*

Supabase automatically creates APIs locally.

You get:

* REST APIs
* Realtime APIs
* Same structure as cloud

📌 Important idea:

> **Local APIs behave exactly like cloud APIs**

So what works locally will work in production.

---

### 🖥️ Supabase Studio (Local Dashboard)

* Web-based interface
* Runs locally
* Used to:

  * Create tables
  * View data
  * Write SQL
  * Manage auth

📌 This is your **local control room**.

---

## 6️⃣ How to Stop Supabase Safely

Stopping Supabase means:

* All services shut down
* Data remains stored
* Nothing is deleted

📌 Analogy:

* Closing the office at night
* Files stay inside cupboards

👉 Always stop Supabase properly
Never just close Docker forcefully.

---

## 7️⃣ How to Restart Supabase

Restarting means:

* Services stop
* Services start again
* Data remains unchanged

📌 Use restart when:

* Something is not responding
* You changed configuration
* Docker had issues

Restart is **safe** and common.

---

## 8️⃣ How to Reset Supabase (⚠️ Dangerous)

Reset means:
❌ All local data is deleted
❌ Database is wiped
❌ Auth users are removed

📌 Analogy:

* Burning all files
* Rebuilding office from scratch

👉 Use reset only when:

* You want a clean start
* You are practicing
* You fully understand the loss

⚠️ Never reset without backup if data matters.

---

## 9️⃣ Common Problems & Safety Rules

### Common beginner issues:

❌ Docker not running
❌ Port already in use
❌ Force stopping containers
❌ Resetting accidentally

### Safety rules:

✅ Always stop Supabase properly
✅ Backup before reset
✅ Treat local like production
✅ Learn locally, deploy confidently

---

## ✅ Key Takeaways

* Local Supabase = Supabase on your own computer
* Uses Docker to run services
* Same behavior as cloud Supabase
* Perfect for learning and testing
* Stop → safe
* Restart → safe
* Reset → **destructive**
