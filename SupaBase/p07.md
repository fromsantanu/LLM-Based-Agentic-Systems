# 📘 Chapter 7: Supabase Authentication (Auth)

Authentication is **how Supabase knows who you are**.
Without Auth, Supabase is just a database.
With Auth, it becomes a **secure multi-user system**.

---

## 1️⃣ What Authentication Means (Very Simply)

**Authentication = proving identity**

📌 Real-life example:

* You enter a building
* Security asks for your ID card
* If valid → entry allowed

In Supabase:

* User logs in
* Supabase checks credentials
* If valid → user gets access

Supabase Auth is built **directly on the database** using **PostgreSQL**.

---

## 2️⃣ What Supabase Auth Gives You (Out of the Box)

Supabase Auth handles:

* User sign-up
* Login
* Logout
* Password management
* Session handling
* Token generation

👉 You **do not** need to build these yourself.

This is why Supabase is so popular.

---

## 3️⃣ Authentication Methods in Supabase

Supabase supports multiple login methods.

---

### 📧 Email & Password

*(Most common)*

* User enters email and password
* Supabase verifies
* User is logged in

📌 Analogy:

* Username + password for your email account

Best for:

* Learning
* Admin panels
* Traditional apps

---

### ✉️ Magic Link

*(Passwordless login)*

* User enters email
* Supabase sends a login link
* Clicking link logs the user in

📌 Analogy:

* One-time entry pass sent by email

Best for:

* Simple apps
* Non-technical users

---

### 🌐 OAuth (Google, GitHub, etc.)

*(Social login)*

* Login using Google / GitHub
* Supabase trusts the provider

📌 Analogy:

* Showing your office ID from another company

We will cover this later in detail.

---

## 4️⃣ The `auth.users` Table (Very Important)

When a user signs up, Supabase stores them in a **system table**:

👉 **`auth.users`**

This table contains:

* User ID (UUID)
* Email
* Login provider
* Creation time

⚠️ Important:

* You **should not edit this table manually**
* Supabase manages it for you

📌 Think of this as:

* The **official ID registry**
* Managed by Supabase security staff

---

## 5️⃣ User ID (UUID) – The Key Concept

Every user gets a **unique ID**.

Example (not real):

```
a3f1c9e2-9b12-4c3a-9a88-7d123456abcd
```

👉 This ID is:

* Unique
* Never changes
* Used to link user data

📌 Real-life analogy:

* Aadhaar number
* Employee ID

Names and emails can change — IDs should not.

---

## 6️⃣ Linking Auth Users to Your Own Tables

This is how **real applications work**.

### Example:

You want a `profiles` table.

```text
auth.users   →   profiles
```

### `profiles` table example:

| column     | meaning               |
| ---------- | --------------------- |
| id         | same as auth.users.id |
| name       | display name          |
| role       | student / admin       |
| created_at | timestamp             |

📌 Key idea:

> Your table uses the **same user ID** as Supabase Auth

This allows:

* Secure access
* Clean relationships
* Easy permissions

---

## 7️⃣ Authentication vs Authorization (Common Confusion)

### Authentication

👉 Who are you?

### Authorization

👉 What are you allowed to do?

Supabase:

* Auth → identifies user
* **RLS (Row Level Security)** → controls access

📌 Important:

> Login alone does **not** give access to data
> RLS decides everything

We will cover RLS in the next chapter.

---

## 8️⃣ Viewing Users in Supabase Dashboard

In the dashboard:

* Go to **Authentication**
* Open **Users**

You can:

* See registered users
* See login method
* Disable or delete users

📌 Treat this like:

* An **admin panel**
* Changes affect real users

---

## 9️⃣ Common Beginner Mistakes (Avoid These)

❌ Assuming login = full access
❌ Not linking users to tables
❌ Manually editing `auth.users`
❌ Exposing service role key in frontend

👉 Remember:
**Auth identifies → RLS authorizes**

---

## ✅ Key Takeaways (Must Remember)

* Supabase Auth handles login securely
* Users are stored in `auth.users`
* Each user has a unique ID
* Your tables should link to that ID
* Auth ≠ permission (RLS controls data)
