# 📘 Chapter 3: Creating a Supabase Project (Cloud)

In this chapter, we will **actually start working with Supabase**.
By the end of this chapter, you will clearly understand:

* How to create a project
* What the important keys mean
* What you see inside the dashboard

No coding yet — only **foundation knowledge**.

---

## 1️⃣ Creating a Free Supabase Account

Go to the official website of **Supabase**.

You can sign up using:

* Email & password
* GitHub account

📌 **Simple explanation**
Creating a Supabase account is like **registering your company** before opening an office.
Without registration, you cannot create projects.

👉 Supabase offers a **free tier**, which is more than enough for:

* Learning
* Testing
* Small projects

---

## 2️⃣ Creating a New Supabase Project

After login, you will see the **Supabase dashboard**.

### Steps to create a project:

1. Click **“New Project”**
2. Choose an **organization** (default is fine)
3. Give your project a **name**
4. Set a **database password**

   * Store this safely
5. Choose a **region** (nearest to you)
6. Click **Create Project**

⏳ The project takes **1–2 minutes** to be ready.

📌 **Real-life analogy**
This is like:

* Renting an office space
* Installing cupboards
* Setting up security locks

Once done, your backend office is ready.

## 3️⃣ Understanding Important Project Details

After project creation, Supabase gives you **three very important things**.

---

### 🌐 Project URL

*(The office address)*

* This is the base URL for your backend
* All API requests go through this URL

📌 Example meaning (not actual value):

```
https://your-project-id.supabase.co
```

👉 Think of it as:

* Your **office building address**
* Anyone who wants to talk to your backend uses this address

---

### 🔑 Public Anon Key

*(Visitor access card)*

* This key is **safe to use in frontend**
* Used by:

  * Websites
  * Mobile apps
* Works **only with security rules (RLS)**

📌 Very important:

* This key **cannot bypass security**
* It only allows what your rules permit

👉 Analogy:
A **visitor pass**:

* Can enter reception
* Cannot open restricted rooms

---

### 🚨 Service Role Key

*(Master key – very dangerous if leaked)*

⚠️ **This is extremely important**

* This key has **full access**
* It **bypasses all security rules**
* Must be used **only on servers**
* Never expose it in:

  * Browser
  * Mobile apps
  * Public code

📌 Analogy:
This is the **master key of the building**.

* Opens every room
* Ignores all locks

❌ If leaked → your entire database is compromised.

👉 Rule to remember:

> **Anon key → frontend
> Service role key → backend only**
