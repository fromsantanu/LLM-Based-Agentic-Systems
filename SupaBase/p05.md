# 📘 Chapter 5: PostgreSQL Basics for Supabase

### *(Very Important — this is the foundation)*

If Supabase is the **office building**, then **PostgreSQL** is the **main record system** inside it.
If you understand this chapter well, **Supabase will feel easy and logical**.

---

## 1️⃣ What is PostgreSQL in Supabase?

Supabase uses **PostgreSQL** as its core database.

👉 Important idea (remember this always):

> **Supabase does not hide PostgreSQL.
> Supabase is PostgreSQL with helpful tools around it.**

So we start with the **basics**.

---

## 2️⃣ Tables, Rows, and Columns

### *(Excel-like analogy)*

Think of a database table like an **Excel sheet**.

### 📄 Table

* One Excel file → One table
* Example: `students`, `patients`, `employees`

### ➡️ Rows

* One row = one record
* Example:

  * One student
  * One patient
  * One employee

### ⬇️ Columns

* One column = one type of information
* Example:

  * `name`
  * `age`
  * `email`

📌 **Very simple example**

| id | name  | age |
| -- | ----- | --- |
| 1  | Rahul | 20  |
| 2  | Anita | 22  |

* Table name: `students`
* Rows: Rahul, Anita
* Columns: id, name, age

👉 This structure is the **heart of Supabase**.

---

## 3️⃣ Primary Key

### *(Unique identity)*

A **primary key** is:

* A column that **uniquely identifies** each row
* Usually called `id`

📌 Example:

* Two students can have the same name
* But **ID must be unique**

| id | name  |
| -- | ----- |
| 1  | Rahul |
| 2  | Rahul |

👉 Primary key rule:

* No duplicates
* No empty value

📌 **Real-life analogy**
Like an **Aadhaar number**:

* Names can repeat
* ID cannot

---

## 4️⃣ Foreign Key

### *(Connecting tables)*

A **foreign key** connects one table to another.

📌 Example:

* One table: `students`
* Another table: `marks`

| students |      |
| -------- | ---- |
| id       | name |

| marks |            |       |
| ----- | ---------- | ----- |
| id    | student_id | score |

Here:

* `student_id` in `marks`
* Refers to `id` in `students`

👉 This creates a **relationship**.

📌 **Real-life analogy**
Like:

* Student roll number written in the marks register
* It points back to the student record

---

## 5️⃣ Common Data Types

### *(Type of information stored)*

Each column must have a **data type**.

---

### 🔤 Text

* Names
* Email
* Address

Example: `"Santanu"`

---

### 🔢 Number

* Age
* Price
* Marks

Example: `25`, `99.50`

---

### 📅 Date / Time

* Date of birth
* Appointment time
* Created date

Example: `2026-02-03`

---

### 🧩 JSON

*(Very powerful)*

* Stores flexible data
* Looks like structured text

Example:

```json
{
  "bp": "120/80",
  "sugar": "normal"
}
```

📌 Why JSON is useful:

* Data shape can change
* Very useful for:

  * Medical records
  * AI metadata
  * Configurations

---

## 6️⃣ Schema Concept

### *(Folders inside the database)*

A **schema** is like a **folder** that holds tables.

Supabase mainly uses:

* **`public` schema**

📌 Meaning:

* All your normal tables go inside `public`
* Supabase system tables may use other schemas

📌 **Analogy**

* Computer → Folder → Files
* Database → Schema → Tables

👉 For beginners:

> **Use `public` schema only**
> That is perfectly fine.

---

## 7️⃣ Viewing Tables in Supabase Dashboard

Supabase makes PostgreSQL **visual and friendly**.

### Where to see tables:

* Go to **Table Editor**
* Select **public schema**
* Click on a table

You can:

* View rows
* Add new data
* Edit values
* Delete rows (carefully!)

📌 **Important**

* Changes here affect the real database
* This is not a demo screen

---

## 8️⃣ Why This Chapter Is Critical

Most Supabase problems happen because:
❌ Database basics are not clear
❌ Relationships are misunderstood
❌ Data types are chosen wrongly

👉 Once PostgreSQL basics are clear:

* RLS becomes easy
* APIs make sense
* Auth linking is simple

---

## ✅ Key Takeaways (Must Remember)

* Table = Excel sheet
* Row = One record
* Column = One property
* Primary key = Unique identity
* Foreign key = Relationship
* Schema = Folder for tables
* Supabase = PostgreSQL at the center
