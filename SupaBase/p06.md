# 📘 Chapter 6: Creating Tables in Supabase

This chapter is **hands-on**.
Here you will learn **how to actually create tables**, add data, and avoid common beginner mistakes.

Think of this as **building cupboards and putting files inside them**.

---

## 1️⃣ Two Ways to Create Tables in Supabase

Supabase gives you **two safe methods**:

1. **Table Editor (UI method)** – beginner friendly
2. **SQL Editor (code method)** – powerful and precise

Both create **real PostgreSQL tables**.

Supabase is built on **PostgreSQL**, so whatever you create here is standard SQL.

---

## 2️⃣ Creating a Table Using Table Editor (UI Method)

### When to use this?

✅ Beginners
✅ Learning phase
✅ Simple tables

### Steps (simple flow)

1. Open **Table Editor**
2. Choose **public schema**
3. Click **New Table**
4. Give the table a name

   * Example: `students`
5. Add columns
6. Save the table

📌 **Analogy**
This is like:

* Drawing a form
* Deciding what fields the form has
* Then printing it for use

---

### Example: `students` Table (UI)

| Column name | Type       | Meaning              |
| ----------- | ---------- | -------------------- |
| id          | int / uuid | Unique student ID    |
| name        | text       | Student name         |
| age         | int        | Student age          |
| created_at  | timestamp  | Record creation time |

👉 Supabase can **auto-create `id`** for you.
Always accept that as a beginner.

---

## 3️⃣ Creating a Table Using SQL Editor (Code Method)

### When to use this?

✅ More control
✅ Reproducible setup
✅ Advanced logic

### Simple SQL example

```sql
create table students (
  id bigint generated always as identity primary key,
  name text,
  age integer,
  created_at timestamp with time zone default now()
);
```

📌 What this means (plain language):

* Create a table called `students`
* Each student gets a unique ID
* Name is text
* Age is a number
* Creation time is automatic

👉 SQL Editor is like **writing exact instructions** instead of clicking buttons.

---

## 4️⃣ Adding Data (Rows) to a Table

Once the table exists, we can add data.

---

### Method 1: Insert using Table Editor

1. Open the table
2. Click **Insert row**
3. Fill values
4. Save

📌 Very safe for learning.

---

### Method 2: Insert using SQL

```sql
insert into students (name, age)
values ('Rahul', 20);
```

📌 This is faster when adding many rows.

---

## 5️⃣ Understanding Constraints (Rules)

Constraints are **rules** applied to columns.

### Common constraints you will see:

#### 🔑 Primary Key

* Ensures unique identity
* No duplicates allowed

#### ❗ Not Null

* Field cannot be empty
* Example: name should not be blank

```sql
name text not null
```

📌 Think of constraints as **form validation rules**.

---

## 6️⃣ Default Columns You Should Always Use

Good practice for almost all tables:

| Column     | Why             |
| ---------- | --------------- |
| id         | Unique identity |
| created_at | Track creation  |
| updated_at | Track changes   |

Supabase supports automatic timestamps.

📌 This helps in:

* Debugging
* Auditing
* Sorting data

---

## 7️⃣ Viewing and Editing Tables Safely

From **Table Editor**, you can:

* View rows
* Edit values
* Delete rows

⚠️ Important warning:

* Delete is **permanent**
* There is no “undo”

📌 Treat the dashboard like:

* Editing an Excel file **connected to real data**

---

## 8️⃣ Common Beginner Mistakes (Very Important)

❌ Forgetting primary key
❌ Using wrong data type
❌ Storing numbers as text
❌ Creating too many tables too early
❌ Deleting rows without backup

👉 Always **design first**, then create tables.

---

## 9️⃣ Simple Design Rule (Follow This)

Before creating a table, ask:

1. What does one row represent?
2. What fields are required?
3. Which field must be unique?
4. Can this table relate to another?

📌 This avoids 80% of future problems.

---

## 1️⃣0️⃣ Practice Example (Recommended)

Create these tables:

* `students`
* `teachers`
* `classes`

Later, we will **connect them using foreign keys**.

---

## ✅ Key Takeaways

* Supabase tables are real PostgreSQL tables
* UI method = beginner friendly
* SQL method = powerful and reusable
* Always use:

  * Primary key
  * Correct data types
  * Timestamps
* Design before you create
