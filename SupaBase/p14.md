# 📘 Chapter 14: Supabase Realtime

### *(Live updates without refreshing the page)*

Until now, all data access was **request → response**.
But many applications need **live updates**.

👉 Chat messages
👉 Live dashboards
👉 Status changes

That is where **Realtime** comes in.

---

## 1️⃣ What Does “Realtime” Mean? (Very Simple)

**Realtime = data updates are pushed automatically**

📌 Normal behavior:

* App asks: “Any new data?”
* Server replies

📌 Realtime behavior:

* Server says: “Data changed!”
* App updates immediately

📌 Real-life analogy

* Phone call → realtime
* Letter → request-based

---

## 2️⃣ What Supabase Realtime Does

Supabase Realtime:

* Listens to database changes
* Sends updates instantly to connected clients

It works on top of **PostgreSQL** change streams.

👉 You don’t poll the database.
👉 Supabase pushes updates to you.

---

## 3️⃣ Types of Realtime Events

Supabase can notify you when:

* A row is **inserted**
* A row is **updated**
* A row is **deleted**

📌 Example:

* New chat message inserted → show instantly
* Status updated → dashboard refreshes
* Record deleted → remove from UI

---

## 4️⃣ How Realtime Fits into Supabase Architecture

Here is the **simple flow**:

1. Client subscribes to a table
2. Database changes occur
3. Supabase detects the change
4. Event is sent to subscribed clients

📌 Important:

* Realtime still respects **RLS**
* Users see only what they are allowed to see

---

## 5️⃣ Common Real-Life Use Cases

### 💬 Chat Applications

* New message appears instantly
* No refresh required

### 📊 Live Dashboards

* Numbers update in real time
* Useful for monitoring

### 🟢 Status Tracking

* Online / offline
* Process state changes

---

## 6️⃣ When You SHOULD Use Realtime

Use Realtime when:

✅ Immediate feedback is important
✅ Multiple users see shared data
✅ UI must reflect live state

📌 Example:

* Classroom attendance dashboard
* Hospital bed status board
* Team collaboration tool

---

## 7️⃣ When You SHOULD NOT Use Realtime

Do **not** use Realtime when:

❌ Data changes rarely
❌ Page refresh is acceptable
❌ Large tables change frequently
❌ You want to reduce resource usage

📌 Overusing Realtime can:

* Increase load
* Add unnecessary complexity

---

## 8️⃣ Realtime + RLS (Very Important)

Supabase Realtime **does not bypass security**.

Even if:

* User is subscribed
* Table is public

👉 Realtime events are filtered by **RLS policies**.

📌 Meaning:

> If user cannot SELECT a row,
> user will not receive its realtime events.

This is a **huge security advantage**.

---

## 9️⃣ Simple Mental Model

* Database changes → events
* Realtime listens → broadcasts
* RLS filters → protects
* Client updates → UI refresh

📌 Same security model, different delivery method.

---

## 🔟 Common Beginner Mistakes

❌ Using Realtime for everything
❌ Forgetting RLS policies
❌ Subscribing to huge tables
❌ Ignoring disconnect handling

👉 Realtime is powerful, but **selective use is key**.

---

## ✅ Key Takeaways

* Realtime enables live updates
* No polling required
* Built on PostgreSQL changes
* Fully respects RLS
* Ideal for chat, dashboards, monitoring
* Not needed for every app
