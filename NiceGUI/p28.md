# **Lesson 28 — Using Cards to Summarize Key Statistics**

## ⭐ What you will learn in this lesson

In this lesson, you will learn how to use **cards** in NiceGUI to show important numbers and statistics in a clean, easy-to-read way.

Cards help you show things like:

* **Total patients**
* **Active patients today**
* **Visits this week**
* **Pending reports**
* **Monthly earnings**
* **Number of prescriptions**

Doctors love dashboards where big numbers are shown clearly at the top.
Cards make your dashboard look organized, modern, and professional.

# 🧠 Real-life example

Imagine a doctor opens your clinic dashboard.
At the very top, there are four simple cards:

| Cards                       | Meaning                                |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| 🩺 **Total Patients: 320**  | How many patients are registered       |
| 👥 **Active Today: 15**     | How many came today                    |
| 📅 **Visits This Week: 42** | Activity level of the clinic           |
| 📄 **Pending Reports: 4**   | How many lab reports are still awaited |

Even without reading any table, the doctor immediately understands what’s happening.

We’ll learn how to create such cards.

---

# **Step-by-step: Let’s build it**

We will create:

* A row of 4 cards
* Each card will show one statistic
* The statistics will update automatically every few seconds

This is the basic building block for a real clinic dashboard.

---

# ✅ Step 1: Install NiceGUI

If you already installed it, skip this step.

```bash
pip install nicegui
```

---

# ✅ Step 2: Write the code for the cards

Create a new file:
**lesson28_cards_dashboard.py**

Paste this code:

```python
from nicegui import ui
import random

# Example statistics (in real apps these come from database)
stats = {
    "total_patients": 320,
    "active_today": 12,
    "visits_this_week": 40,
    "pending_reports": 5,
}

def update_stats():
    # Random updates (only for simulation)
    stats["active_today"] += random.choice([-1, 1])
    if stats["active_today"] < 0:
        stats["active_today"] = 0

    stats["visits_this_week"] += random.choice([0, 1])
    stats["pending_reports"] += random.choice([-1, 1])
    if stats["pending_reports"] < 0:
        stats["pending_reports"] = 0

def refresh_cards():
    card1.set_text(f"Total Patients: {stats['total_patients']}")
    card2.set_text(f"Active Today: {stats['active_today']}")
    card3.set_text(f"Visits This Week: {stats['visits_this_week']}")
    card4.set_text(f"Pending Reports: {stats['pending_reports']}")

with ui.page("/"):
    ui.label("Clinic Summary Dashboard").classes("text-2xl mb-4")

    with ui.row().classes("w-full justify-between"):

        card1 = ui.card().classes("p-4 text-lg")
        card1_text = ui.label(f"Total Patients: {stats['total_patients']}")

        card2 = ui.card().classes("p-4 text-lg")
        card2_text = ui.label(f"Active Today: {stats['active_today']}")

        card3 = ui.card().classes("p-4 text-lg")
        card3_text = ui.label(f"Visits This Week: {stats['visits_this_week']}")

        card4 = ui.card().classes("p-4 text-lg")
        card4_text = ui.label(f"Pending Reports: {stats['pending_reports']}")

    # Automatically update everything
    def timer_update():
        update_stats()
        refresh_cards()

    ui.timer(interval=3.0, callback=timer_update)

ui.run()
```

# ✨ Explanation in simple words

Let’s break everything into small, easy pieces.

---

## 1️⃣ We begin by importing our tools

```python
from nicegui import ui
import random
```

* `ui` → helps build the web page
* `random` → just to simulate changes in stats

In a real clinic dashboard, the stats would come from a database, not random numbers.

---

## 2️⃣ We create some example statistics

```python
stats = {
    "total_patients": 320,
    "active_today": 12,
    "visits_this_week": 40,
    "pending_reports": 5,
}
```

These are simple numbers to show inside the cards.

---

## 3️⃣ Function to update the statistics

```python
def update_stats():
```

This modifies the numbers a little each time, so the cards “feel alive.”

---

## 4️⃣ Function to refresh card text

```python
def refresh_cards():
```

This updates the text displayed inside each card.

---

## 5️⃣ Creating the dashboard page

```python
with ui.page("/"):
```

This is your main dashboard page.

---

## 6️⃣ Adding a title

```python
ui.label("Clinic Summary Dashboard").classes("text-2xl mb-4")
```

A big title at the top.

---

## 7️⃣ Create a row of cards

```python
with ui.row().classes("w-full justify-between"):
```

This places the cards side-by-side in one row.

Each card:

```python
card1 = ui.card().classes("p-4 text-lg")
ui.label(f"Total Patients: {stats['total_patients']}")
```

* `ui.card()` → makes the card box
* `ui.label()` → shows the number inside the card

We repeat this for all 4 cards.

---

## 8️⃣ Using a timer to auto-update the cards

```python
ui.timer(interval=3.0, callback=timer_update)
```

Every 3 seconds:

* stats change
* cards update

This gives a **real-time** feeling.

---

## 9️⃣ Running the app

```python
ui.run()
```

---

# 🚀 How to run and test

1. Save the file:
   `lesson28_cards_dashboard.py`

2. Run it:

```
python lesson28_cards_dashboard.py
```

3. Open your browser:

```
http://localhost:8080
```

Watch the numbers update every 3 seconds!

You just created a **clean, real-time card-based dashboard**.

# 💡 Tips & Best Practices

### ✔ Tip 1 — Use icons

NiceGUI lets you add icons easily:

```python
ui.icon('person')
```

Adding small icons makes cards more attractive.

---

### ✔ Tip 2 — Use colors

You can apply colors to cards:

```python
ui.card().classes("bg-blue-100 p-4")
```

Use green for “good”, red for “warning”, yellow for “pending.”

---

### ✔ Tip 3 — Replace random updates with real numbers

Connect this dashboard to your backend:

* Total patients → SQL count
* Active today → count visits for today
* Pending reports → list from table

Then your dashboard becomes fully real.
