# **Lesson 2: Installation and Basic Project Setup**

In this lesson, you will learn how to install NiceGUI and create your very first project folder.
Think of this as setting up your table before you start building your Lego model.

## **Step 1: Install Python (if not already installed)**

NiceGUI runs on Python.
If Python is not installed, download it from:

**[https://www.python.org/downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads)**

Install it like any normal app.
(Just keep clicking **Next**, like installing WhatsApp.)

---

## **Step 2: Install NiceGUI**

Once Python is ready, open your terminal or command prompt and type:

```
pip install nicegui
```

This tells your computer:
“Please bring me the NiceGUI toolkit so I can start building interfaces.”

It usually takes a few seconds.

---

## **Step 3: Create a Project Folder**

Let’s make a clean place where all your NiceGUI code will live.

Choose any place you like and create a folder called:

```
nicegui_projects
```

Inside it, create another folder:

```
lesson2_project
```

This folder will hold your first small NiceGUI app.

---

## **Step 4: Create a Basic NiceGUI File**

Inside **lesson2_project**, create a Python file named:

```
app.py
```

Now add this very small starter code:

```python
from nicegui import ui

ui.label('Welcome to NiceGUI!')

ui.run()
```

---

## **Step 5: Understand the Code (Very Simple Words)**

**`from nicegui import ui`**
This opens the NiceGUI toolbox—like opening your Lego kit.

**`ui.label('Welcome to NiceGUI!')`**
This creates one simple text message on the screen.

**`ui.run()`**
This starts the app and shows it in your browser.

That’s all!
Even a single line of NiceGUI makes something visible.

---

## **Step 6: Run Your First NiceGUI App**

Open your terminal, go inside your project folder:

```
cd nicegui_projects/lesson2_project
```

Then run:

```
python app.py
```

You will see something like:

```
Running on http://localhost:8080
```

---

## **Step 7: Open the App in Your Browser**

Open your browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge…)
Type this in the address bar:

```
http://localhost:8080
```

You will see:

**Welcome to NiceGUI!**

Congratulations — you have run your first NiceGUI program!

---

## **Tips for Beginners**

### **Tip 1: Keep your project folder clean**

Each lesson or app can have its own folder.
It makes life simple and avoids confusion.

### **Tip 2: Always run from the correct folder**

Before typing `python app.py`, make sure you are inside the same folder as the file.
Just like opening a book before reading it.
