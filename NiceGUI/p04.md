# **Lesson 4: Understanding NiceGUI’s Layout System (Rows, Columns, Cards)**

In this lesson, you will learn how NiceGUI arranges things on the screen.
Think of layout like **arranging items on a table** — sometimes side by side, sometimes one above another, sometimes inside a neat little box.

NiceGUI gives you simple “containers” to organize your UI:

* **row** → items side by side
* **column** → items one below another
* **card** → a neat box with a border and padding

You’ll practice all three.

---

## **Step 1: Create a New Project Folder**

Create a folder named:

```
lesson4_layouts
```

Inside it, make a file named:

```
layout_demo.py
```

---

## **Step 2: Add the Layout Code**

Paste the following code into **layout_demo.py**:

```python
from nicegui import ui

ui.label('Understanding layouts: rows, columns, and cards')

with ui.row():
    ui.label('Item A')
    ui.label('Item B')
    ui.label('Item C')

with ui.column():
    ui.button('Top Button')
    ui.button('Middle Button')
    ui.button('Bottom Button')

with ui.card():
    ui.label('This is inside a card')
    ui.button('A card button')

ui.run()
```

---

## **Step 3: Understand the Layouts (Simple Words)**

### ✔ **ui.row()**

This makes items appear **next to each other in a line**.
Like placing pens side by side on a desk.

### ✔ **ui.column()**

This stacks items **top to bottom**.
Like placing books in a vertical pile.

### ✔ **ui.card()**

A card is a **small box with padding** (extra space around the items) and often a border.
It makes things look neat — like putting your items in a small gift box.

---

## **Step 4: Line-by-Line Explanation**

**`from nicegui import ui`**
Bring NiceGUI into your program.

---

**`ui.label('Understanding layouts...')`**
Shows a heading at the top of the page.

---

### **Row**

```
with ui.row():
    ui.label('Item A')
    ui.label('Item B')
    ui.label('Item C')
```

This says:
“Whatever is inside this block, place them side by side.”

* Item A
* Item B
* Item C
  → all appear in one horizontal line.

---

### **Column**

```
with ui.column():
    ui.button('Top Button')
    ui.button('Middle Button')
    ui.button('Bottom Button')
```

This says:
“Stack my buttons one below the other.”

---

### **Card**

```
with ui.card():
    ui.label('This is inside a card')
    ui.button('A card button')
```

This creates a clean-looking box containing:

* a label
* a button

It keeps them grouped visually.

---

**`ui.run()`**
Starts your NiceGUI app.

---

## **Step 5: Run Your Layout Demo**

Open your terminal:

```
cd lesson4_layouts
```

Run:

```
python layout_demo.py
```

Then visit the shown address, usually:

```
http://localhost:8080
```

You will see:

* a row of labels
* a column of buttons
* a card with items inside

---

## **Tips for Beginners**

### **Tip 1: Use rows to organize horizontally**

Buttons in one line?
Labels in one line?
Use a `row()`.

### **Tip 2: Use cards to group related items**

Cards make your interface look clean and easy to understand.
Use them for:

* a login form
* a small control panel
* grouped settings
