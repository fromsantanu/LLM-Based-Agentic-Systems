# **Lesson 23 — Adding Charts and Graphs with NiceGUI + Plotly / Matplotlib**

## ⭐ What you will learn in this lesson

In this lesson, you will learn how to show **simple charts** inside a NiceGUI web page.
Charts help you **see data like sales, marks, or temperatures** in an easy way—just like looking at a picture instead of reading numbers.

We will create:

* one chart using **Plotly** (very interactive and colorful)
* one chart using **Matplotlib** (simple and classic)

Both will appear on a NiceGUI web page.

# 🧠 Real-life example

Imagine you run a small shop. You wrote down how many items you sold each day:

* Monday → 10
* Tuesday → 20
* Wednesday → 15

A picture (chart) of this data helps you quickly “see” which day was best.

---

# **Step-by-step: Let’s build it**

## ✅ Step 1: Install the required libraries

In your terminal, type:

```
pip install nicegui plotly matplotlib
```

This gives you the tools to draw charts.

---

## ✅ Step 2: Create a NiceGUI page

We will make a page that shows:

1. A Plotly line chart
2. A Matplotlib bar chart

Here is the **full code** (kept simple):

```python
from nicegui import ui
import plotly.graph_objects as go
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# --- Plotly Chart ---
def make_plotly_chart():
    days = ["Mon", "Tue", "Wed"]
    sales = [10, 20, 15]

    fig = go.Figure(data=go.Scatter(x=days, y=sales, mode="lines+markers"))
    return fig

# --- Matplotlib Chart ---
def make_matplotlib_chart():
    days = ["Mon", "Tue", "Wed"]
    sales = [10, 20, 15]

    plt.figure(figsize=(4, 3))
    plt.bar(days, sales)
    return plt.gcf()

# --- NiceGUI Page ---
with ui.page("/"):
    ui.label("Sales Charts").classes("text-2xl")

    ui.label("Plotly Chart (Interactive)")
    ui.plotly(make_plotly_chart())

    ui.separator()
    ui.label("Matplotlib Chart (Simple)")
    ui.pyplot(make_matplotlib_chart())

ui.run()
```

# ✨ Explanation of the code (in very simple words)

### **1. Importing tools**

```python
from nicegui import ui
import plotly.graph_objects as go
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```

* `nicegui` → helps us build web pages
* `plotly` → helps us draw fancy charts
* `matplotlib` → helps us draw simple bar/line charts

---

### **2. Building the Plotly chart**

```python
def make_plotly_chart():
    days = ["Mon", "Tue", "Wed"]
    sales = [10, 20, 15]

    fig = go.Figure(data=go.Scatter(x=days, y=sales, mode="lines+markers"))
    return fig
```

* We store days and sales in lists
* `Scatter` draws a line with points
* `fig` is the final chart we will show on the page

---

### **3. Building the Matplotlib chart**

```python
def make_matplotlib_chart():
    days = ["Mon", "Tue", "Wed"]
    sales = [10, 20, 15]

    plt.figure(figsize=(4, 3))
    plt.bar(days, sales)
    return plt.gcf()
```

* `plt.bar()` draws bars
* `gcf()` means “get current figure” → returns the picture

---

### **4. Creating the NiceGUI page**

```python
with ui.page("/"):
    ui.label("Sales Charts").classes("text-2xl")

    ui.label("Plotly Chart (Interactive)")
    ui.plotly(make_plotly_chart())

    ui.separator()
    ui.label("Matplotlib Chart (Simple)")
    ui.pyplot(make_matplotlib_chart())
```

* We create a page at `http://localhost:8080/`
* First chart: Plotly
* A separator line
* Second chart: Matplotlib

---

### **5. Running the app**

```python
ui.run()
```

This starts the NiceGUI server.

---

# 🚀 How to run and test

1. Save the file as **lesson23.py**
2. Open your terminal in the same folder
3. Run:

```
python lesson23.py
```

4. Open your browser and go to:

```
http://localhost:8080
```

You will see both charts on your page!

# 💡 Tips & Best Practices

### **Tip 1 — Start simple**

Use very small datasets first.
Once the chart works, then add bigger data (like CSV or database values).

### **Tip 2 — Use Plotly for dashboards**

If you're building dashboards or want charts that you can zoom, hover, and move, Plotly is usually easier and more attractive.
