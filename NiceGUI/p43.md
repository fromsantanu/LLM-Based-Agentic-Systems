# **Lesson 43: Making Dashboards Responsive for Mobile**

### **What you will learn**

In this lesson, you will learn how to make your NiceGUI dashboard **adjust automatically** when viewed on a mobile phone.

A responsive UI means:

* On **big screens** → you show items in rows
* On **small screens** → items shift into columns
* Text becomes readable
* Buttons and cards adjust their size

Think of it like water in a container.
Water changes its shape depending on the container.
Similarly, your dashboard will change shape depending on the screen size.

# **1. Why mobile responsiveness matters**

Many users open apps on:

* small phones
* medium tablets
* large laptops
* big monitors

A good UI must “fit” everywhere.
Otherwise, buttons get cut, text looks tiny, and users struggle.

NiceGUI uses **Tailwind CSS utility classes** to make things responsive very easily.

---

# **2. Understanding Responsive Classes (Simple Explanation)**

Tailwind has simple codes like:

* `sm:` → for **small screens**
* `md:` → for **medium screens**
* `lg:` → for **large screens**

Example:
`sm:w-full lg:w-1/3`

This means:

* on small screens → width is 100%
* on large screens → width is 33%

It’s like saying:
“Take the full width on mobile, but only one-third on desktop.”

---

# **3. Responsive Dashboard Cards Example**

### **Code**

```python
from nicegui import ui

def stat_card(title, value, icon_name):
    with ui.card().classes(
        'p-4 flex flex-col items-center gap-2 '
        'sm:w-full md:w-1/2 lg:w-1/3 transition-all'
    ):
        ui.icon(icon_name).classes('text-4xl')
        ui.label(title).classes('text-md text-gray-600')
        ui.label(value).classes('text-2xl font-bold')


with ui.row().classes('flex-wrap gap-4 p-4'):
    stat_card("Total Patients", "124", "group")
    stat_card("Today's Visits", "32", "event")
    stat_card("Reports Pending", "18", "description")

ui.run()
```

### **Simple explanation**

* `sm:w-full`
  → on small screens, each card takes full width (1 card per row)

* `md:w-1/2`
  → on medium screens, 2 cards per row

* `lg:w-1/3`
  → on large screens, 3 cards per row

* `flex-wrap`
  → allows cards to move to next line when screen gets small

This instantly makes your dashboard mobile-friendly.

---

# **4. Responsive Layout for Charts + Cards**

A dashboard usually has:

* some cards
* a big chart
* maybe a table

Here is a responsive layout where the chart moves below the cards on small screens.

### **Code**

```python
from nicegui import ui

with ui.column().classes('p-4 gap-4'):

    # cards area (flexible grid)
    with ui.row().classes('flex-wrap gap-4'):
        for i in range(1, 4):
            ui.card().classes(
                'p-4 sm:w-full md:w-1/2 lg:w-1/3'
            ).slot(f"Card {i}")

    # chart area
    ui.card().classes(
        'p-4 sm:w-full md:w-2/3 lg:w-1/2'
    ).slot("Chart Area (placeholder)")

ui.run()
```

### **Simple explanation**

* Cards become **stacked** on small screens
* Chart moves **below** cards on mobile
* On desktop, chart sits **beside** cards

---

# **5. Responsive Sidebar (Auto-hides on Mobile)**

### **Code**

```python
from nicegui import ui

with ui.drawer().classes('lg:block hidden') as sidebar:
    ui.label("Sidebar Menu").classes('text-lg font-bold')
    ui.link("Dashboard", "/")
    ui.link("Patients", "/patients")

# Button appears only on mobile screens
ui.button("☰ Menu", on_click=sidebar.toggle) \
    .classes("lg:hidden m-4")

ui.label("Main content area").classes("p-4")

ui.run()
```

### **Simple explanation**

* `lg:block hidden`
  → sidebar is visible on large screens
  → hidden on small screens

* `lg:hidden`
  → the menu button appears only on mobile

This makes your app behave like modern websites.

# **6. Full Responsive Dashboard Example**

Here is everything put together:

### **Code**

```python
from nicegui import ui

def stat_card(title, value):
    with ui.card().classes(
        'p-4 sm:w-full md:w-1/2 lg:w-1/3 '
        'hover:shadow-xl transition-all'
    ):
        ui.label(title).classes('text-md text-gray-600')
        ui.label(value).classes('text-2xl font-bold')

with ui.column().classes('p-4 gap-4'):

    # heading
    ui.label('Clinic Dashboard').classes('text-2xl font-bold')

    # cards
    with ui.row().classes('flex-wrap gap-4'):
        stat_card("Today’s Patients", "45")
        stat_card("Follow-ups", "12")
        stat_card("Pending Reports", "6")

    # chart placeholder
    ui.card().classes(
        'sm:w-full md:w-3/4 lg:w-1/2 p-4'
    ).slot("Chart goes here")

ui.run()
```

### **What this gives you**

On a **phone**:

* everything stacks neatly in one column
* no overflow
* text stays readable

On a **desktop**:

* 3 cards in a row
* large chart area
* clean layout

---

# **How to Test Responsiveness**

1. Run the file:

   ```
   python lesson43.py
   ```
2. Open your browser at:
   **[http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)**
3. Now try:

   * Resize the browser window
   * Make it very narrow like a mobile
   * Make it wide like a laptop
4. Watch how:

   * cards change size
   * layout rearranges
   * menus appear/disappear

This is mobile responsiveness.

---

# **Tips & Best Practices**

### **1) Always use `flex-wrap` for dashboards**

Cards will move to next line instead of getting squeezed.

### **2) Test on real mobile**

Even if it looks okay on desktop, always check with a phone.
