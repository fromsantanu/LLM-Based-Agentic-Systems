# **Lesson 15: Form Basics – Text Box, Dropdown, Radio Buttons, Date/Time Pickers**

### **What you will learn**

In this lesson, you will create a small form using NiceGUI.
This form will collect simple details from the user, like typing in their name, choosing options from dropdowns and radio buttons, and selecting a date or time.

Think of this form like a **small slip** that you fill when you visit a clinic—your name, gender, appointment date, etc.

---

# **Real-life example**

Imagine you are booking a doctor’s appointment.
The form may ask:

* Your name → (text box)
* Your gender → (radio buttons)
* Your city → (dropdown list)
* Appointment date → (date picker)
* Appointment time → (time picker)

We will build this simple form in NiceGUI.

# **Step-by-step explanation**

### **Step 1: Import NiceGUI**

You need NiceGUI to create web pages and components.

### **Step 2: Create each form element**

* A **text box** for name
* A **dropdown** for city
* A set of **radio buttons** for gender
* A **date picker**
* A **time picker**

### **Step 3: Add a submit button**

When the user clicks the button, we will show all collected information on the screen.

# **NiceGUI Code Example**

```python
from nicegui import ui

# Form heading
ui.label('Appointment Form').classes('text-h5')

# Text box
name = ui.input('Enter your name')

# Dropdown list
city = ui.select(
    ['Kolkata', 'Delhi', 'Mumbai', 'Chennai'],
    label='Select your city'
)

# Radio buttons
gender = ui.radio(
    { 'M': 'Male', 'F': 'Female', 'O': 'Other' },
    label='Gender'
)

# Date picker
appointment_date = ui.date(label='Choose appointment date')

# Time picker
appointment_time = ui.time(label='Choose appointment time')

# Submit button
def submit():
    ui.notify(
        f"Name: {name.value}\n"
        f"City: {city.value}\n"
        f"Gender: {gender.value}\n"
        f"Date: {appointment_date.value}\n"
        f"Time: {appointment_time.value}"
    )

ui.button('Submit', on_click=submit)

ui.run()
```

# **Line-by-line explanation (very simple)**

* `ui.label()` → shows a heading on the page
* `ui.input()` → creates a text box for typing
* `ui.select()` → creates a dropdown menu
* `ui.radio()` → shows multiple round options to choose one
* `ui.date()` → opens a small calendar to pick a date
* `ui.time()` → lets you choose a time
* `ui.button()` → creates a button
* `submit()` function → collects all the form values and shows them in a small popup
* `ui.run()` → starts the web page

---

# **How to run the code**

1. Save the file as **lesson15_form.py**
2. Open a terminal/command prompt
3. Run:

```
python lesson15_form.py
```

4. Your browser will open automatically
   (or visit [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080))

You will see the form and can fill it like a real appointment slip.

# **Tips & Best Practices**

### ⭐ Tip 1

Always add **labels** to form elements so users understand what to enter.

### ⭐ Tip 2

Keep forms short and simple.
Too many fields make users feel tired.
