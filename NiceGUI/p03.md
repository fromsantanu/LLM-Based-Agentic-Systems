# **Lesson 3: Running Your First NiceGUI Page**

In this lesson, you will learn how to create and run a simple NiceGUI page.
Think of a “page” as a small screen in your app—just like opening a new page in a notebook.

We will build a page that shows a message and a button.
This is like writing a note on a page and sticking a small button on it.

---

## **Step 1: Create a New Project Folder**

Make a folder for this lesson:

```
lesson3_page
```

Inside this folder, create a file named:

```
main.py
```

This file will hold your NiceGUI code.

---

## **Step 2: Add Simple Page Code**

Open **main.py** and type:

```python
from nicegui import ui

@ui.page('/')
def home_page():
    ui.label('This is your first NiceGUI page!')
    ui.button('Click Me', on_click=lambda: ui.notify('Button clicked!'))

ui.run()
```

---

## **Step 3: Understand the Code (Explained Like a Story)**

**`from nicegui import ui`**
This brings the NiceGUI toolbox so you can build things.

---

**`@ui.page('/')`**
This line tells NiceGUI:
“Make a page for me at the main address.”
(“/” means homepage, like the first page of a new notebook.)

---

**`def home_page():`**
This creates a function (a small machine) that builds what appears on the page.

---

**`ui.label('This is your first NiceGUI page!')`**
This writes a message on your page.

---

**`ui.button('Click Me', on_click=lambda: ui.notify('Button clicked!'))`**
This creates a button.
When you press it, a small popup message appears.
Think of it like ringing a tiny doorbell and hearing “ding!”.

---

**`ui.run()`**
This starts the app and opens the page in your browser.

---

## **Step 4: Run the Page**

Open your terminal and go to your project folder:

```
cd lesson3_page
```

Now run:

```
python main.py
```

You will see something like:

```
Running on http://localhost:8080
```

---

## **Step 5: Open the Page in the Browser**

Open Chrome, Firefox, or any browser.
Type:

```
http://localhost:8080
```

You will see:

* A line of text
* A button
* A popup when you click the button

You’ve successfully created your first page!

---

## **Step 6: Change the Page Address (Optional Fun)**

NiceGUI allows you to create pages at different addresses.

Try changing:

```python
@ui.page('/')
```

to:

```python
@ui.page('/hello')
```

Now run again and open:

```
http://localhost:8080/hello
```

This helps you create multiple pages later (home page, dashboard page, settings page, etc.).

---

## **Tips for Beginners**

### **Tip 1: Keep pages small at first**

Create pages with:

* one message
* one button
* one input

This helps you learn slowly and confidently.

### **Tip 2: Think of pages like chapters in a book**

Each page can show different content.
You can build big apps by combining many simple pages.
