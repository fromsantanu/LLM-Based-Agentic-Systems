# Chapter 8. Case Studies

This chapter demonstrates how MCP-enabled workflows can be applied in **healthcare**, **finance**, and **education**. Each case study focuses on integrating MCP servers into agentic AI systems, showing how structured message passing and real-time context can solve domain-specific problems.

## 8.1 Healthcare Assistant with MCP-enabled Workflows

Healthcare workflows often involve structured intake, diagnostic reasoning, and recovery monitoring. By combining MCP servers with agentic orchestration, we can streamline these processes:

**Workflow Design:**

1. **Patient Intake:**

   * Patient reports symptoms through a chatbot.
   * MCP parses input into structured JSON (SOAP format: Subjective, Objective, Assessment, Plan).

2. **Diagnosis/Triage:**

   * Agent queries an MCP server connected to a medical knowledge base (e.g., ICD-10 codes, clinical guidelines).
   * Returns possible diagnoses with confidence scores.

3. **Treatment Path:**

   * MCP server integrates with hospital scheduling APIs (appointments, lab tests).
   * The agent suggests next steps: lab test, medication, referral.

4. **Recovery Monitoring:**

   * Follow-up reminders sent via messaging APIs.
   * MCP logs patient-reported outcomes for later review.

**Example Interaction:**

```
Patient → "I have a sore throat, mild fever, and difficulty swallowing."
Agent → MCP (intake server) → JSON: {"symptoms": ["sore throat", "fever", "dysphagia"]}
Agent → MCP (medical guidelines server) → Suggested diagnosis: Pharyngitis (confidence: 0.72)
Agent → "You may need a throat swab test. Would you like to schedule it?"
```

**Benefits:**

* Standardized, structured medical data
* Safer triage with knowledge-backed recommendations
* Continuous monitoring and follow-up

## 8.2 Financial Research with Live MCP Data Feeds

Financial research requires **real-time market insights**, **historical data**, and **custom analytics**. MCP servers enable structured access to these sources.

**Workflow Design:**

1. **Live Data Feeds:**

   * MCP connected to stock tickers, currency exchange APIs, and commodity prices.
   * Streams structured data (JSON: symbol, price, timestamp).

2. **Research Query:**

   * Agent receives a request: “Summarize Tesla’s stock trends in the past week.”
   * MCP fetches historical OHLC (open-high-low-close) data from the feed.

3. **Analytics & Reporting:**

   * MCP pipeline integrates with Python financial libraries (Pandas, TA-Lib).
   * Computes indicators (moving averages, volatility, RSI).
   * Summarizes findings in natural language.

**Example Interaction:**

```
User → "What’s Tesla’s 7-day performance?"
Agent → MCP (financial data feed) → JSON: {"TSLA": [price series]}
Agent → "TSLA rose 4.2% this week, with strong momentum above the 20-day moving average."
```

**Benefits:**

* Structured market intelligence for quick decision-making
* Ability to combine real-time and historical analysis
* Reduces manual data wrangling for researchers

## 8.3 Education Tutor Agent Retrieving Structured Curriculum Data

Education-focused agents benefit from structured access to curriculum, lessons, and progress tracking. MCP servers can store and serve this data consistently.

**Workflow Design:**

1. **Curriculum Access:**

   * MCP server stores course modules in structured format:

     ```
     {"subject": "Algebra", "module": "Linear Equations", "difficulty": "Intermediate"}
     ```

2. **Adaptive Tutoring:**

   * Student asks: “Explain quadratic equations with examples.”
   * Agent queries MCP curriculum database for relevant content.
   * Returns lesson notes + practice problems.

3. **Progress Tracking:**

   * MCP server logs completed modules and quiz results.
   * Agent adjusts difficulty and suggests next steps.

4. **Interactive Q\&A:**

   * Student asks a follow-up question.
   * Agent retrieves structured definitions, theorems, and worked examples.

**Example Interaction:**

```
Student → "I want to practice quadratic equations."
Agent → MCP (curriculum server) → JSON: {"topic": "Quadratic Equations", "examples": [x^2 + 5x + 6 = 0]}
Agent → "Here’s an example: Solve x² + 5x + 6 = 0. Try factoring."
```

**Benefits:**

* Personalized learning paths
* Structured curriculum ensures consistency
* Easy integration with gamification and quizzes

## Key Takeaways

* **Healthcare Assistants** benefit from structured intake, triage, and follow-ups.
* **Financial Researchers** gain real-time and historical insights from MCP-powered feeds.
* **Education Tutors** provide adaptive, structured learning experiences.

MCP servers act as the **backbone of structured knowledge exchange**, ensuring agentic workflows are safe, reliable, and domain-specific.
