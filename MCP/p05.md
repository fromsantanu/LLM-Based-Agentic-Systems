# Chapter 5. Common Workflows

In real-world agentic systems, MCP servers shine when used as bridges between structured data, APIs, and intelligent agents. This chapter outlines the most common workflows developers build with MCP and shows how to connect the pieces effectively.

## 5.1 Data Retrieval from Knowledge Bases and Vector DBs

Many agentic applications rely on **retrieving information from large corpora**—documents, research papers, or structured enterprise knowledge. MCP provides a consistent interface to query these sources.

### Example Workflow

1. **Query** → Agent transforms user input into structured JSON (e.g., `{"query": "hypertension treatment"}`).
2. **MCP Call** → Server connected to a vector DB (e.g., Chroma, Pinecone, Qdrant).
3. **Response** → Retrieved chunks with metadata and embeddings.
4. **Agent Processing** → LLM composes an answer or integrates results into downstream steps.

```json
{
  "query": "latest guidelines for hypertension",
  "top_k": 5,
  "filters": {"source": "WHO"}
}
```

MCP normalizes this request/response cycle, so the agent can switch between backends (knowledge base, SQL DB, or vector DB) without changing its logic.

## 5.2 API Orchestration with MCP

Agents often need to **call multiple APIs in sequence**, passing intermediate results from one service to the next. MCP helps orchestrate these chains reliably.

### Example Workflow

* **User Request**: “Book me a train from Oxford to London at 10 AM and summarize the weather forecast.”
* **Steps**:

  1. MCP server calls **railway booking API**.
  2. MCP server calls **weather API** with date/time.
  3. Agent merges results and presents them to the user.

Because MCP abstracts API calls into request/response objects, agents can treat diverse services (transport, healthcare, finance) in a unified way.

## 5.3 Document Parsing and Q\&A

MCP servers can ingest and parse documents (PDFs, Word, HTML) into structured formats for question-answering workflows.

### Example Workflow

1. **Input**: User uploads a PDF medical guideline.
2. **MCP Server**: Extracts text, tables, and metadata.
3. **Vectorization**: Sends chunks to a vector DB via another MCP server.
4. **Q\&A Agent**: Answers user questions like:

   > “What’s the recommended first-line treatment for type 2 diabetes?”

This reduces boilerplate around parsing libraries and ensures agents get **clean, structured input**.

## 5.4 Monitoring and Logging with MCP

Observability is essential when agents interact with multiple systems. MCP can be used as a **logging and monitoring layer**:

* Capture **all requests/responses** exchanged with external services.
* Store **execution traces** (input, output, latency, errors).
* Provide **dashboards or alerting hooks** (e.g., notify on repeated failures).

### Example Monitoring Flow

* **Agent** calls knowledge base → **MCP logs query, response size, response time**.
* **MCP** pushes logs to Elasticsearch or Prometheus.
* **Developer** inspects workflows for bottlenecks or failure rates.

This improves reliability and helps maintain compliance in sensitive domains (e.g., healthcare, finance).

✅ **Key Takeaway**:
By combining retrieval, orchestration, parsing, and monitoring, MCP servers act as the backbone of **reliable and extensible agentic workflows**, letting developers focus on higher-level reasoning instead of boilerplate integration.
