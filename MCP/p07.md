## Chapter 7. Security & Governance

Security and governance are essential for running MCP servers in production, especially when agents have the ability to call external APIs, access sensitive data, or trigger system-level actions. A well-designed governance framework ensures that only authorized agents can interact with MCP servers, prevents malicious use, and provides visibility into usage patterns.

### 7.1 Authentication & Permissions

* **Authentication methods**

  * **API Keys / Tokens**: Simple to implement, suitable for internal systems.
  * **OAuth2 / OpenID Connect**: Best for multi-tenant systems and user delegation.
  * **mTLS (mutual TLS)**: Strong option for service-to-service authentication.

* **Permission Scoping**

  * Define **fine-grained roles**: e.g., `read_only`, `data_writer`, `admin`.
  * Assign **per-endpoint access controls**: Only agents requiring a specific capability should have permission.
  * **Principle of least privilege**: Agents get access only to what they need.

* **Example**

  ```yaml
  permissions:
    agent_A:
      - read_patient_data
      - query_embeddings
    agent_B:
      - write_logs
    agent_admin:
      - "*"
  ```

### 7.2 Preventing Malicious Agent → MCP Interactions

* **Input validation**: Sanitize and validate every request from agents.
* **Rate limiting**: Protect against denial-of-service attempts.
* **Command whitelisting**: Only allow approved operations—avoid raw shell execution or unsafe database queries.
* **Sandboxing**: Run MCP servers in isolated containers/VMs to limit potential impact of a compromised agent.
* **Threat monitoring**: Use intrusion detection and anomaly detection to flag unusual request patterns.

### 7.3 Logging & Audit Trails

* **Centralized logging**: Collect logs from all MCP servers for visibility.

* **Structured logs**: Use JSON format with fields like `timestamp`, `agent_id`, `action`, `status`.

* **Audit trails**: Keep immutable records of all sensitive interactions (e.g., data access, config changes).

* **Compliance-ready**: Logs should meet GDPR/HIPAA/SOX requirements where applicable.

* **Example Log Entry**

  ```json
  {
    "timestamp": "2025-09-19T10:22:33Z",
    "agent_id": "diagnosis_agent",
    "action": "query_patient_db",
    "status": "success",
    "resource": "patients/12345"
  }
  ```

### 7.4 Cost & Resource Usage Control

* **Usage quotas**: Limit the number of requests or compute cycles per agent.

* **Budget allocation**: Assign resource budgets (e.g., GPU hours, API credits) to projects or teams.

* **Real-time monitoring**: Track compute, memory, and API spend through dashboards.

* **Auto-throttling**: Reduce priority or suspend agents when thresholds are exceeded.

* **Alerts & notifications**: Send alerts when costs approach budget limits.

* **Best Practices**

  * Combine **rate limits + quotas** for both security and cost savings.
  * Use **per-agent cost dashboards** to identify inefficient workflows.
  * Integrate billing APIs (e.g., OpenAI usage logs, cloud provider billing) into governance tools.

✅ **Key Takeaway**:
Security and governance in MCP-based agentic systems are not optional—they are the foundation for safe, compliant, and cost-effective operation. Strong authentication, fine-grained permissions, proactive prevention of malicious interactions, immutable audit logs, and careful cost/resource controls ensure that MCP servers can scale responsibly in production environments.
