# 11. Performance Considerations in High-Throughput Agent Systems

When building **agentic healthcare systems** (or any high-throughput agent pipelines), **performance bottlenecks** can occur due to repeated data validation, unnecessary object creation, or inefficient schema handling. Pydantic v2 introduces several improvements that make validation faster and more efficient, but careful design is still critical when scaling to thousands of requests per second.

This chapter covers **model caching**, **avoiding redundant parsing**, and **practical patterns** for optimizing Pydantic in high-throughput agent workflows.

## 11.1 Why Performance Matters in Agent Systems

Agentic healthcare workflows often involve:

* Thousands of **patient check-ins** per day.
* Dozens of downstream **micro-agents** (triage, diagnostic, compliance, billing, etc.).
* **Multiple API integrations** with external systems (HIS, LIS, EMR).

Without optimization, each agent could end up re-validating the same patient data repeatedly, wasting CPU cycles.

---

## 11.2 Model Caching

Pydantic internally compiles and caches validators for speed. Still, you should **reuse models** instead of dynamically redefining them inside function calls.

### ✅ Good Practice

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel

class PatientCheckIn(BaseModel):
    patient_id: str
    name: str
    age: int
    symptoms: list[str]

# Reused across agents
def process_checkin(data: dict) -> PatientCheckIn:
    return PatientCheckIn.model_validate(data)
```

### ❌ Bad Practice

```python
def process_checkin(data: dict):
    # Redefining model inside function = no caching benefit
    class PatientCheckIn(BaseModel):
        patient_id: str
        name: str
        age: int
        symptoms: list[str]
    return PatientCheckIn.model_validate(data)
```

> **Tip:** Always define models **once at the module level**, not inside loops or functions.

---

## 11.3 Avoiding Redundant Parsing

When data has already been validated, avoid re-validating it unnecessarily.

### Example: Queue Validation

A **Queue Manager Agent** receives thousands of patient check-ins per day. Instead of re-validating the same record at each stage:

```python
def queue_patient(patient: PatientCheckIn):
    # Store the already validated model object
    queue.append(patient)
```

Later agents can consume the **already-validated Pydantic object**, rather than re-parsing the raw dict.

```python
def diagnostic_agent(patient: PatientCheckIn):
    # No re-validation needed here
    if patient.age > 65:
        print("High-risk patient flagged for priority care")
```

---

## 11.4 Pydantic V2 Performance Improvements

Pydantic v2 (built on **pydantic-core**) is significantly faster than v1 because:

* Validation is implemented in **Rust**, not Python.
* **Compiled schema caching** reduces repeated parsing cost.
* `.model_validate()` and `.model_dump()` are optimized for batch workflows.

For bulk data (like hospital batch uploads), you can use `TypeAdapter`:

```python
from pydantic import TypeAdapter
from typing import List

adapter = TypeAdapter(List[PatientCheckIn])

# Validate batch of patient check-ins in one go
validated_patients = adapter.validate_python(raw_patient_list)
```

This avoids per-object overhead and leverages vectorized validation logic.

---

## 11.5 Example: High-Throughput Check-In Queue

Imagine a large hospital where **5,000+ patients check in daily**.

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel, TypeAdapter
from typing import List

class PatientCheckIn(BaseModel):
    patient_id: str
    age: int
    symptoms: list[str]

# Adapter for batch validation
adapter = TypeAdapter(List[PatientCheckIn])

def process_bulk_checkins(raw_data: list[dict]):
    patients = adapter.validate_python(raw_data)  # Fast batch parse
    for patient in patients:
        queue_patient(patient)  # Store validated object
    return len(patients)
```

✅ Efficient

* Validates all patient records in **one pass**.
* Uses **cached schema compilation**.
* Avoids re-validation at downstream agents.

---

## 11.6 Key Takeaways

* **Define models once** (reuse them across agents).
* **Cache validated objects** instead of re-validating at every step.
* Use **TypeAdapter** for **batch validation** in high-throughput pipelines.
* Prefer **`.model_validate()`** over `__init__()` for optimized validation.
* Leverage **Pydantic v2’s Rust-powered validation** for maximum throughput.

---

📌 **Example Use Case:**
In a hospital system with thousands of daily patient check-ins, the **Queue Manager Agent** validates patient data once using Pydantic v2. The validated objects are then passed downstream to triage, diagnostic, and billing agents **without redundant parsing** — reducing latency and improving system throughput.
