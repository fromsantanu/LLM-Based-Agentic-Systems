# **Chapter 10. Advanced Agent Architectures**

As agentic systems mature, they need to go beyond simple tool-calling or retrieval. Real-world applications demand **flexibility, autonomy, and robustness**. In this chapter, we‚Äôll explore advanced agent architectures that combine reasoning, decision-making, and planning.

## Routing Agents (Choosing the Right Expert Agent)

When dealing with multiple specialized agents, it‚Äôs inefficient to let one general agent handle everything. Instead, **routing agents** decide which expert is best suited for the task.

* **Motivation**: Imagine a customer support bot. Billing questions should go to a *Billing Agent*, technical questions to a *Tech Agent*, and policy questions to a *Compliance Agent*.
* **Approach**:

  1. The router agent analyzes the query.
  2. It selects the correct expert agent (or chain).
  3. The chosen agent solves the problem.

In LangChain, this is implemented with the **MultiRouteChain** or custom routing logic.

üîë **Tip**: Use embeddings to semantically route tasks (e.g., ‚ÄúIs this a finance-related question?‚Äù).

## ReAct (Reason + Act) Pattern in LangChain

The **ReAct pattern** was introduced to combine **chain-of-thought reasoning** with **action execution**.

* **Reasoning**: The agent explains to itself *why* a step is needed.
* **Action**: The agent takes a concrete step, like calling a tool or querying a database.
* **Observation**: The agent evaluates the result.
* **Repeat**: Loop until a final answer is reached.

In LangChain, this looks like:

```python
from langchain.agents import initialize_agent, load_tools
from langchain.llms import OpenAI

llm = OpenAI(temperature=0)
tools = load_tools(["serpapi", "llm-math"], llm=llm)

agent = initialize_agent(tools, llm, agent="zero-shot-react-description", verbose=True)

agent.run("Who is the current UN Secretary General and what is 23*7?")
```

Here, the agent will reason, decide to use the search tool for the first part, then the calculator for the second part.

üîë **Insight**: ReAct agents are more explainable since their reasoning is part of the output.

## Self-Reflection and Self-Correction Loops

Even advanced agents make mistakes. To improve reliability, they can **reflect on their own outputs** and correct themselves.

* **Self-Reflection**: After producing an answer, the agent reviews its reasoning for errors or inconsistencies.
* **Self-Correction**: If issues are found, the agent attempts a revised solution.

LangChain supports this via **Evaluator chains** or meta-agents. For example:

```python
from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate
from langchain.chains import LLMChain

reflection_prompt = PromptTemplate(
    input_variables=["output"],
    template="Review the following output for correctness and clarity:\n{output}\nSuggest corrections if needed."
)

reflection_chain = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=reflection_prompt)

response = agent.run("Explain quantum entanglement in 3 sentences.")
review = reflection_chain.run(output=response)

print("Agent response:", response)
print("Reflection:", review)
```

üîë **Best practice**: Pair reflection loops with scoring functions (e.g., factuality, safety, relevance).

## Planning and Execution Frameworks (BabyAGI, AutoGPT Style)

Recent research has explored **autonomous agents** that plan, prioritize, and execute tasks toward long-term goals.

* **BabyAGI**: A lightweight task manager that continuously creates, prioritizes, and executes tasks.
* **AutoGPT**: A more advanced framework that generates plans, executes tasks, evaluates results, and adapts strategies.

### Core Idea:

1. **Define a goal** (e.g., ‚ÄúResearch top 5 AI startups in healthcare‚Äù).
2. **Planner agent** breaks it into sub-tasks.
3. **Executor agent(s)** perform each task.
4. **Memory system** stores completed tasks.
5. **Loop** continues until the goal is satisfied.

In LangChain, you can prototype this with **Task Decomposition Chains** + **Memory**.

Example (simplified BabyAGI in LangChain):

```python
from langchain.experimental import BabyAGI
from langchain.vectorstores import FAISS
from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings

embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings()
vectorstore = FAISS(embedding_function=embeddings)

baby_agi = BabyAGI.from_llm_and_vectorstore(
    llm=llm,
    vectorstore=vectorstore,
    task_execution_chain=agent,
    max_iterations=5
)

baby_agi.run("Find latest research trends in medical imaging AI")
```

üîë **Caution**: These frameworks can **hallucinate goals** or drift without constraints. Always bound them with domain-specific rules and guardrails.

## Key Takeaways

* **Routing agents** specialize workflows by sending tasks to the right expert.
* **ReAct pattern** brings together reasoning and tool use, making agents smarter and explainable.
* **Self-reflection loops** allow agents to improve reliability by reviewing their own outputs.
* **Planning + execution frameworks** (BabyAGI, AutoGPT) move towards autonomous, goal-driven agents.

These advanced architectures are stepping stones toward **fully autonomous multi-agent ecosystems** where humans and AI collaborate on complex tasks with minimal oversight.
