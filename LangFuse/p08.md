# Chapter 8: Advanced Patterns

As your agentic AI systems grow in complexity, traditional observability is no longer enough. You need advanced strategies to capture signals across Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines, safeguard autonomous decisions, log multi-modal interactions, and handle sensitive data responsibly. LangFuse provides the primitives, and this chapter shows how to extend them for real-world production use.

## 8.1 Observability for RAG Pipelines

RAG systems combine **document retrieval** with **LLM grounding**. Debugging these pipelines requires visibility into every stage:

* **Trace spans for retrieval calls**

  * Log query embeddings and vector store search results.
  * Record candidate documents with relevance scores.

* **Grounding quality monitoring**

  * Attach retrieved context to the LLM span.
  * Evaluate how much of the final answer comes from the retrieved docs vs hallucination.

* **Metrics to track**

  * Retrieval latency (ms per query).
  * Hit rate (% queries where relevant docs retrieved).
  * Answer grounding score (semantic overlap between context and response).

ðŸ“Œ *Best practice*: Store retrieved documents as metadata in LangFuse, then link them to the downstream answer span for easy root-cause debugging.

## 8.2 Tracking Autonomous Decision-Making with Guardrails

When agents make **autonomous choices** (e.g., deciding which tool to call or when to escalate), logging the *decision policy* is crucial.

* **Log decision trees**

  * Capture reasoning chains that led to a branch (e.g., *Agent chose `book_flight` tool because user intent = travel*).

* **Guardrails**

  * Define acceptable bounds for decisions (e.g., medical workflow cannot suggest prescription).
  * Log when guardrails are triggered or overridden.

* **Metrics to track**

  * Frequency of guardrail violations.
  * % of decisions escalated to a human.
  * Success rate of autonomous decisions vs human-in-the-loop.

ðŸ“Œ *Best practice*: Use LangFuse spans to annotate both *intended action* and *executed action*. This helps detect drift between policy and actual execution.

## 8.3 Capturing Multi-Modal Agent Interactions

Modern agents interact beyond text: images, audio, video, or even sensor streams. Observability must extend across modalities:

* **Text + Image**

  * Log prompts, responses, and base64 image references.
  * Store thumbnails for quick inspection (with access control).

* **Speech + Text**

  * Capture ASR transcripts + confidence scores.
  * Link to raw audio file IDs.
  * Track TTS outputs for latency and naturalness.

* **Cross-modal grounding**

  * Link how one modality influences another (e.g., *caption generated from uploaded image â†’ used in answer*).

ðŸ“Œ *Best practice*: Keep raw media in secure object storage, and log only metadata + references in LangFuse for efficient and safe tracking.

## 8.4 Privacy and Data Governance in Logging Sensitive Data

Observability introduces risk when working with **PII, PHI, or sensitive business data**. LangFuse supports redaction and compliance-aware logging.

* **Strategies**

  * **Selective logging**: only store metadata (e.g., doc IDs, hash digests) instead of raw text.
  * **Redaction pipelines**: mask sensitive fields (e.g., patient names, SSNs) before ingestion.
  * **Access control**: restrict sensitive traces to compliance-cleared users.

* **Compliance frameworks**

  * GDPR: user data erasure requests.
  * HIPAA: logging without storing identifiers.
  * SOC 2: audit trails for data access.

ðŸ“Œ *Best practice*: Implement a data governance layer before LangFuse ingestion. Think of LangFuse as *observability for engineering*, not as a database for raw sensitive data.

## Key Takeaways

* RAG observability requires linking retrieval spans, grounding context, and final answers.
* Autonomous decision-making must be tracked with clear guardrails and escalation logs.
* Multi-modal interactions (text, image, audio) need unified tracing across modalities.
* Privacy and governance practices (redaction, selective logging, access control) are essential for production-grade AI.
