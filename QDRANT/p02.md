# **Chapter 2. Getting Started with Qdrant**

In this chapter, we’ll set up **Qdrant**, explore different installation options, and learn how to access it both locally and through the cloud. You’ll also be introduced to the **Web UI** and **REST API** for interacting with your collections.

---

## 2.1 Installing Qdrant

Qdrant can be installed in multiple ways depending on your environment and preference.

### **Option 1: Using Docker (Recommended)**

```bash
docker run -p 6333:6333 -p 6334:6334 qdrant/qdrant
```

* Exposes:

  * `6333` → REST API
  * `6334` → gRPC
* Data is stored in the container by default (you can mount volumes for persistence).

### **Option 2: Installing from Binaries**

1. Download the latest release from [Qdrant GitHub Releases](https://github.com/qdrant/qdrant/releases).
2. Extract and run:

   ```bash
   ./qdrant
   ```

   By default, Qdrant listens on port `6333`.

### **Option 3: Qdrant Cloud**

* Fully managed hosting solution.
* No need to manage servers or scaling.
* Signup: [cloud.qdrant.io](https://cloud.qdrant.io).
* Provides free tier for experimentation.

## 2.2 Running Qdrant Locally

Once installed, start Qdrant:

* **Docker**

  ```bash
  docker run -d -p 6333:6333 qdrant/qdrant
  ```

* **Binary**

  ```bash
  ./qdrant
  ```

Check if Qdrant is running:

```bash
curl http://localhost:6333/healthz
```

Expected response:

```json
{"status":"ok"}
```

---

## 2.3 Overview of Qdrant Cloud

Qdrant Cloud gives you:

* **Managed clusters** – auto-scaling, high availability
* **Usage dashboard** – monitor queries and storage
* **API Keys** – secure access control
* **Backups & monitoring** – built-in reliability

It’s a great choice when you want to skip infrastructure setup and focus on building applications.

---

## 2.4 Using the Web UI & REST API

### **Web UI**

* Accessible at `http://localhost:6333/dashboard` (local) or via Qdrant Cloud.
* Allows you to:

  * Create and manage collections
  * Insert and search vectors
  * Monitor cluster performance

### **REST API**

Qdrant provides a simple REST API for operations.

**Example: Check health**

```bash
curl http://localhost:6333/healthz
```

**Example: Create a collection**

```bash
curl -X PUT "http://localhost:6333/collections/my_collection" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
           "vectors": {
             "size": 768,
             "distance": "Cosine"
           }
         }'
```

**Example: Insert vectors**

```bash
curl -X PUT "http://localhost:6333/collections/my_collection/points" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
           "points": [
             {"id": 1, "vector": [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, ...], "payload": {"doc": "hello"}},
             {"id": 2, "vector": [0.4, 0.5, 0.6, ...], "payload": {"doc": "world"}}
           ]
         }'
```

**Example: Search vectors**

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:6333/collections/my_collection/points/search" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
           "vector": [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, ...],
           "limit": 2
         }'
```

✅ At this stage, you should be able to **run Qdrant locally or on the cloud**, explore the **Web UI**, and make basic **REST API calls** to manage collections and vectors.
