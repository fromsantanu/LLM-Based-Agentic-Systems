# **Chapter 3. Core Concepts**

Understanding the **core concepts** of Qdrant is essential before diving into practical usage. These building blocksâ€”collections, points, payloads, vectors, distance metrics, and indexingâ€”form the foundation of how Qdrant manages and retrieves information.

## 3.1 Collections, Points, and Payloads

Qdrant organizes data into a **hierarchical structure**:

* **Collection**
  A collection is like a "table" in a relational database. It groups together points with similar characteristics.
  Example: a collection named `movies` may store vector embeddings of movie plots.

* **Point**
  A point is the **basic unit of storage** inside a collection. Each point has:

  * A unique ID (integer or UUID).
  * A vector (the embedding).
  * An optional payload (structured metadata).

* **Payload**
  Payloads are key-value pairs (like JSON fields) attached to points.
  They allow filtering or hybrid queries (vector search + metadata).
  Example:

  ```json
  {
    "title": "Inception",
    "genre": "Sci-Fi",
    "year": 2010
  }
  ```

ðŸ‘‰ Together: *Collection â†’ contains Points â†’ each Point stores a Vector + Payload.*

## 3.2 Vectors and Embeddings

* **Vector**
  A vector is a list of numbers (floats) that represent an object in a high-dimensional space.

* **Embedding**
  An embedding is a specific type of vector generated by ML models (e.g., sentence transformers, CLIP, OpenAI embeddings).

  * Text embeddings â†’ represent meaning of words, sentences, or documents.
  * Image embeddings â†’ represent visual similarity.
  * Audio embeddings â†’ represent sound features.

Example of a 5-dimensional embedding:

```json
[0.12, -0.87, 0.33, 0.41, -0.22]
```

Qdrant stores these embeddings for **semantic search, recommendations, and similarity matching**.

## 3.3 Distance Metrics

Qdrant compares vectors using **distance (or similarity) metrics**:

* **Cosine Similarity**
  Measures the angle between two vectors, ignoring their magnitude.

  * Best for: semantic text search.
  * Range: \[-1, 1] (higher = more similar).

* **Dot Product**
  Multiplies corresponding elements and sums them.

  * Best for: embeddings that encode similarity via dot product.
  * Larger values = more similar.

* **Euclidean Distance (L2)**
  Measures the straight-line distance between vectors.

  * Best for: spatial or geometric tasks.
  * Lower values = more similar.

ðŸ‘‰ Choosing the right metric depends on the embedding model and application domain.

## 3.4 Indexing Basics

Qdrant uses **vector indexing** to make similarity search fast, even with millions of points.

* **HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World Graph)**
  The default indexing method in Qdrant.

  * Organizes vectors into a graph structure.
  * Allows logarithmic-time approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search.
  * Balances accuracy and speed.

* **Index Parameters**
  You can configure:

  * `ef_construct` â†’ controls graph building quality.
  * `m` â†’ number of connections per node.
  * `ef_search` â†’ controls accuracy during search (higher = more accurate but slower).

ðŸ‘‰ Without indexing, Qdrant would need to scan every vector (brute force). Indexing ensures **scalability** and **real-time search**.

âœ… **Summary**

* Collections group data; points store vectors + payloads.
* Vectors are numerical representations; embeddings come from ML models.
* Distance metrics define how similarity is measured.
* Indexing (HNSW) makes vector search scalable.
