# **Chapter 11. Case Studies & Projects**

This chapter focuses on **practical applications of Qdrant** by walking through real-world case studies and projects. Each project demonstrates how to combine Qdrant’s vector search capabilities with modern AI tools to solve meaningful problems in search, recommendation, and knowledge management.

## 11.1 Semantic Search over PDFs

### Problem

Traditional keyword search often fails to retrieve relevant sections of documents where wording differs but meaning is similar. Research papers, legal documents, and reports are especially challenging.

### Approach

1. **Extract text from PDFs** using libraries like `PyMuPDF` or `pdfminer`.
2. **Chunk the text** into passages (e.g., 200–500 tokens) for efficient embedding.
3. **Generate embeddings** with OpenAI, HuggingFace, or SentenceTransformers.
4. **Store embeddings in Qdrant**, with metadata linking back to PDF name and page number.
5. **Query Qdrant** using semantic search: user questions → embedding → nearest vector lookup.

### Example Use Case

* Searching through a library of **research papers** to find passages relevant to a clinical trial question.
* Retrieving **legal clauses** across a large corpus of contracts.

## 11.2 Building a Q\&A Chatbot with Qdrant + OpenAI

### Problem

A conversational agent needs to **answer user questions** based on private or domain-specific data not present in OpenAI’s training set.

### Approach

1. **Prepare your dataset** (FAQ, documents, support tickets, etc.).
2. **Embed and store content in Qdrant** with payload metadata.
3. On each user query:

   * Generate query embedding.
   * Retrieve top-k most relevant vectors from Qdrant.
   * Pass retrieved context + user question to OpenAI for a **contextual answer**.
4. Optionally integrate with frameworks like **LangChain** or **LlamaIndex** for orchestration.

### Example Use Case

* A **customer support bot** that uses past support tickets to resolve user issues.
* A **healthcare assistant** that retrieves treatment guidelines for doctors.

## 11.3 Recommendation System using Qdrant

### Problem

Users need **personalized recommendations** based on similarity, e.g., similar products, articles, or videos.

### Approach

1. **Generate embeddings** for items (products, articles, etc.) using a domain-appropriate model (e.g., SentenceTransformers, CLIP for images).
2. **Store embeddings in Qdrant** with metadata (title, category, URL, etc.).
3. **Recommendation logic**:

   * Content-based: Retrieve items similar to what the user viewed.
   * Hybrid: Combine content similarity with collaborative filtering signals.
4. Deliver recommendations through a simple API.

### Example Use Case

* Suggesting **similar research articles** to students.
* Recommending **products** on an e-commerce site.
* Matching **job seekers to roles** based on skill embeddings.

## 11.4 Knowledge Base Assistant with Qdrant

### Problem

Organizations often have **internal documents, wikis, and policies** that employees struggle to navigate.

### Approach

1. **Ingest knowledge base articles** and chunk them into embeddings.
2. **Store in Qdrant** with metadata like article ID, category, update date.
3. **Search pipeline**:

   * Employee query → embedding.
   * Retrieve top-k matches from Qdrant.
   * Present answer snippet or use LLM to summarize.
4. Add **filters** (department, date, access level) for fine-grained retrieval.

### Example Use Case

* A **corporate knowledge assistant** that answers HR or IT queries instantly.
* An **academic assistant** retrieving relevant course material for students.
* A **research lab assistant** surfacing internal project documentation.

## Summary

In this chapter, we explored **hands-on projects** demonstrating Qdrant’s role in:

* Semantic document retrieval (PDFs, research papers, legal text).
* Conversational Q\&A chatbots powered by vector search.
* Personalized recommendation engines.
* Intelligent knowledge assistants for organizations.

These case studies illustrate how Qdrant integrates seamlessly with modern AI ecosystems to create **practical, production-ready applications**.
