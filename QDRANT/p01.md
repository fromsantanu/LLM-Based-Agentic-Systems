# **Chapter 1. Introduction to Vector Databases**

## What is a Vector Database?

A **vector database** is a specialized database designed to store, index, and query **vector embeddings**—high-dimensional numerical representations of data such as text, images, audio, or video.

Traditional databases excel at structured queries (e.g., exact match or relational lookups), but embeddings capture **semantic meaning**. For example, two sentences with different words but similar meaning will have embeddings that are close in vector space.

A vector database enables:

* Efficient storage of large volumes of embeddings.
* Fast similarity search (e.g., nearest neighbor search).
* Metadata filtering and hybrid queries (combining semantic similarity with structured constraints).

## Difference Between Vector DBs and Traditional Databases

| Feature         | Traditional Databases                            | Vector Databases                                          |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Data Type**   | Rows, columns, keys, values (structured data)    | High-dimensional embeddings (float vectors) + metadata    |
| **Querying**    | SQL queries, exact matches, range filters        | Similarity search (cosine, Euclidean, dot product)        |
| **Use Case**    | OLTP transactions, reporting, structured queries | Semantic search, recommendation, pattern matching         |
| **Indexing**    | B-trees, hash indexes                            | ANN (Approximate Nearest Neighbor) indexes like HNSW, IVF |
| **Performance** | Optimized for CRUD and relational joins          | Optimized for similarity search over millions of vectors  |

In short: **traditional DBs answer “what exactly matches this condition?”**
while **vector DBs answer “what is most similar to this item?”**

## Use Cases of Vector Databases

1. **Semantic Search**

   * Query with natural language instead of keywords.
   * Example: Searching *“healthy food options”* retrieves documents mentioning *“nutritious meals”* or *“low-calorie diet.”*

2. **Recommendation Systems**

   * Match users with products, movies, or music by similarity in preference embeddings.
   * Example: Spotify recommending songs with similar “vibe.”

3. **Anomaly Detection**

   * Detect unusual patterns by measuring distance from normal behavior embeddings.
   * Example: Identifying fraudulent financial transactions that don’t fit usual vector patterns.

4. **Chatbots & RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**

   * Retrieve relevant context for LLMs to improve accuracy.
   * Example: Customer support bots that fetch knowledge base entries by semantic similarity.
