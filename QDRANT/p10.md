# **Chapter 10. Advanced Topics**

This chapter explores more advanced capabilities of Qdrant that go beyond the basics of storing and querying vectors. These techniques allow you to customize your workflows, combine modalities, and optimize embeddings for domain-specific tasks.

## Custom Embedding Functions

Most vector database workflows begin with pre-built embeddings from models like OpenAI, HuggingFace, or SentenceTransformers. However, you may need custom embeddings for:

* **Domain specificity**: e.g., medical terminology, legal text, scientific research.
* **Task adaptation**: e.g., embeddings tuned for classification vs. semantic similarity.
* **Resource constraints**: using smaller or quantized models for low-latency systems.

### Strategies

* Train your own embedding model using **contrastive learning** or **triplet loss**.
* Fine-tune existing transformer models on a domain corpus.
* Use lightweight models distilled from larger LLMs.

Once embeddings are generated, Qdrant does not care how they are produced—only that they are fixed-length numeric vectors.

## Hybrid Search (Text + Vectors)

Pure vector search excels at semantic similarity, while traditional keyword search is precise for exact matches. A hybrid approach combines both.

* **Vector search**: Finds semantically similar results, tolerant to paraphrasing.
* **Keyword / BM25 search**: Ensures precise matches for important tokens.
* **Hybrid scoring**: Combines the two, often by weighted sum:

$$
\text{final\_score} = \alpha \cdot \text{vector\_score} + (1-\alpha) \cdot \text{keyword\_score}
$$

### Example use cases

* Search engines (relevance + semantic recall).
* E-commerce (exact brand match + product similarity).
* Healthcare databases (matching drug names while considering synonyms).

Qdrant supports **metadata filtering**, which can act as the structured part of hybrid retrieval when paired with vectors.

## Multi-Modal Data (Image, Audio Embeddings)

Modern applications often involve more than text. Embeddings can represent images, audio, or even video.

* **Image embeddings**: Models like CLIP, OpenCLIP, or ViT convert images into vectors.
* **Audio embeddings**: Models like OpenAI’s Whisper or wav2vec2.0 create audio representations.
* **Cross-modal search**: With models like CLIP, you can retrieve images using text queries, or find captions for images.

### Example Applications

* **E-commerce**: “Search by image” functionality.
* **Media archives**: Find similar music or audio clips.
* **Healthcare**: Radiology images + clinical text search.

Qdrant’s **payloads** allow you to store both raw metadata (like filenames or URLs) and multiple embeddings per item (text, image, audio), enabling flexible queries across modalities.

## Fine-Tuning Embeddings for Specific Domains

Pretrained embeddings are general-purpose, but they may not capture nuances in specialized fields. Fine-tuning helps adapt them.

### Methods

1. **Supervised fine-tuning**: Use labeled pairs (e.g., duplicate questions, matching legal clauses).
2. **Unsupervised fine-tuning**: Use domain-specific corpora with techniques like SimCSE.
3. **Continual pretraining**: Extend a base model’s training on in-domain text before embedding training.

### Benefits

* Higher accuracy in niche search tasks.
* Better clustering of related items.
* Improved downstream tasks (recommendation, anomaly detection).

For example:

* In **biomedical text mining**, fine-tuned embeddings can cluster genes, proteins, or drug interactions.
* In **finance**, embeddings tuned on annual reports capture terms like “EPS,” “derivative exposure,” etc., more effectively than general models.

✅ **Summary**:
Advanced use of Qdrant involves customizing embeddings, blending vector and text search, storing multi-modal data, and fine-tuning embeddings for domain specialization. These capabilities transform Qdrant from a simple semantic store into a robust retrieval engine for real-world, domain-sensitive applications.
