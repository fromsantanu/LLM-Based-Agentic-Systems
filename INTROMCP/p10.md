# **Chapter 10. MCP Tools & Extensions**

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is designed to be extensible by exposing **tools**—discrete capabilities that models can call to interact with external systems, fetch context, or perform computations. Tools are the backbone of MCP’s flexibility, allowing developers to adapt it for both general-purpose and domain-specific workflows.

## Built-in Tool Definitions

MCP provides a standard set of built-in tool categories to cover common model needs:

* **Data Access Tools**

  * Query structured/unstructured data sources.
  * Examples: file search, database connectors, vector search indexes.

* **Communication Tools**

  * Enable messaging between agents, clients, or external APIs.
  * Examples: WebSocket endpoints, HTTP requests.

* **Computation Tools**

  * Run lightweight or delegated computations.
  * Examples: math evaluation, code execution sandboxes.

* **Utility Tools**

  * Provide common helper functions.
  * Examples: date-time parsing, text formatting, summarization pipelines.

Each tool is defined by:

* **Name** (unique identifier)
* **Schema** (input/output contract)
* **Capabilities** (what the tool can perform)

This ensures interoperability across clients and servers.

## Adding Custom Tools to MCP

Developers can extend MCP by registering **custom tools**. The process involves:

1. **Defining the tool schema**

   * Input and output data structures (JSON schema).
   * Validation rules to ensure robustness.

2. **Implementing the tool logic**

   * Custom functions, API calls, or orchestration flows.
   * Example: wrapping a third-party CRM API as an MCP tool.

3. **Exposing the tool via MCP server**

   * The server advertises the new tool to connected clients.
   * Clients can now discover and invoke it as part of workflows.

4. **Testing and documenting**

   * Include examples and expected use cases.
   * Ensure graceful error handling and schema validation.

This modular approach allows teams to add specialized capabilities without modifying the MCP core.

## Extending MCP for Domain-Specific Applications

MCP becomes especially powerful when extended for **domain-specific contexts**. Below are examples of how custom tools can bring value in different industries:

### Healthcare

* **Electronic Health Record (EHR) Connector**
  Fetch patient data (labs, prescriptions, imaging results) in real time.
* **Clinical Decision Support Tool**
  Provide diagnostic suggestions based on guidelines.
* **Medical Device Interface**
  Stream sensor data from wearables or monitoring devices.

### Finance

* **Market Data Tool**
  Retrieve stock prices, FX rates, or crypto data.
* **Risk Analysis Tool**
  Calculate exposure based on portfolio composition.
* **Regulatory Compliance Tool**
  Check financial transactions against compliance rules (AML/KYC).

### Education & Research

* **Knowledge Base Tool**
  Query academic repositories or textbooks.
* **Learning Analytics Tool**
  Monitor student progress and suggest personalized content.
* **Simulation & Modeling Tool**
  Run domain-specific simulations (e.g., epidemiology models).

By tailoring MCP tools to industry requirements, organizations can embed intelligent, context-aware workflows directly into their operations.

✅ **Key takeaway:** MCP’s extensibility through tools and extensions ensures it is not just a protocol for context retrieval—it is a framework for building entire **agentic ecosystems** across industries.
