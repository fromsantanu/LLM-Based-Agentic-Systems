# **Chapter 5. MCP Communication**

Communication is at the heart of the Model Context Protocol (MCP). It defines how clients, servers, and models exchange structured information in a way that is reliable, efficient, and extensible. MCP is deliberately transport-agnostic, but it establishes patterns that can be implemented over a variety of standard channels.

## Transport Layers

MCP does not bind itself to a single transport. Instead, it allows developers to select the most suitable channel based on their environment, latency requirements, and security needs. Commonly used transports include:

* **WebSockets**

  * Ideal for bi-directional, low-latency communication.
  * Maintains an open connection, making it efficient for event-driven scenarios such as streaming data or real-time updates.
  * Popular in browser-based and interactive applications.

* **HTTP/JSON**

  * A natural choice for environments where RESTful services are standard.
  * Works well for request/response patterns with stateless interactions.
  * Easier to integrate in traditional APIs and cloud-native architectures.

* **gRPC and Binary Protocols (Optional)**

  * Useful when performance and compact serialization are critical.
  * Enables streaming and multiplexed communication with strong typing.
  * Often used in large-scale, production-grade systems.

* **Local IPC (Inter-Process Communication)**

  * Shared memory, pipes, or UNIX sockets may be used for tightly coupled deployments (e.g., model processes and servers running on the same machine).
  * Offers high throughput with minimal overhead.

By remaining transport-flexible, MCP ensures it can be adapted to lightweight prototypes as well as enterprise deployments.

## Request/Response Lifecycle

The core of MCP communication is built on a structured request/response pattern. This ensures clarity in how information is exchanged and how errors are surfaced.

1. **Client Issues a Request**

   * A request includes a unique ID, the target operation, and the required context or payload.
   * Example: fetching file metadata, querying a database, or requesting inference from a model.

2. **Server Processes the Request**

   * The server validates the input schema.
   * Context providers or model backends perform the required computation.
   * Errors or validation failures are immediately returned with structured codes and messages.

3. **Server Sends a Response**

   * The response includes the request ID, status, result payload, or error information.
   * This correlation ensures that even in concurrent or multiplexed environments, responses map cleanly to their originating requests.

4. **Client Handles the Response**

   * The client integrates the result into its local workflow.
   * If an error is received, the client may retry, adjust the query, or escalate to the user.

This lifecycle provides predictability while allowing asynchronous, concurrent requests across multiple contexts.

## Event-Driven Communication in MCP

Beyond traditional request/response exchanges, MCP supports **event-driven communication**, allowing servers and models to push updates to clients without an explicit request. This is critical in contexts where the environment changes dynamically or when continuous monitoring is required.

Key event-driven features include:

* **Subscriptions**

  * Clients can subscribe to particular events (e.g., file changes, database updates, sensor readings).
  * Servers notify subscribed clients when relevant updates occur.

* **Streaming Data**

  * Instead of returning a static result, a server may stream partial responses.
  * Useful for scenarios such as:

    * Progressive model inference (tokens arriving incrementally).
    * Real-time monitoring dashboards.
    * Long-running computations with periodic updates.

* **System Events**

  * Heartbeat messages for connection liveness.
  * Error notifications or warnings (e.g., context source unavailable).
  * Session lifecycle events (e.g., session start, pause, resume, terminate).

* **Custom Application Events**

  * MCP allows developers to define domain-specific event types.
  * Example: a healthcare assistant protocol may emit `patient_state_update` events when new vitals are received.

Event-driven communication reduces polling overhead, improves responsiveness, and makes MCP a suitable foundation for agentic and interactive systems.

âœ… **In summary:**
MCP communication blends the predictability of request/response lifecycles with the flexibility of event-driven updates. By abstracting away transport choices and enforcing structured message patterns, it provides a scalable and interoperable foundation for AI-driven applications across diverse deployment environments.
