## **Chapter 3. MCP Architecture**

### High-Level Architecture Overview

The **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** is designed as a lightweight communication framework that enables AI models to interact with their surrounding context in a standardized way. Its architecture is deliberately minimal yet extensible, ensuring that models, clients, and external context sources can exchange information seamlessly.

At a high level, the architecture consists of three layers:

1. **Clients** – Interfaces such as IDEs, applications, or user-facing platforms that initiate requests and consume responses.
2. **Servers (Context Sources)** – Systems that hold or generate contextual data, such as databases, APIs, vector stores, or domain-specific services.
3. **Models** – AI models (LLMs or other intelligent agents) that interpret requests, generate responses, and orchestrate interactions between clients and servers.

The protocol acts as a **bridge** between these entities, ensuring that each component communicates using standardized messages and interaction rules.

### Message Types

MCP communication is based on well-defined **message types**, each serving a distinct role in the dialogue between models and context sources.

1. **Requests**

   * Initiated by a client or model to query a server for context or perform an action.
   * Examples: *“fetch document by ID”*, *“search for vector embeddings”*, *“retrieve user profile data”*.

2. **Responses**

   * Replies to requests, carrying the requested data or an error message if the request could not be fulfilled.
   * Ensures predictable completion of interactions.

3. **Events**

   * Asynchronous notifications that provide updates without requiring a request.
   * Examples: *“new data available”*, *“subscription update”*, *“streaming token emitted”*.

Together, these message types allow for both **synchronous** request/response interactions and **asynchronous** event-driven communication.

### Communication Flow Between Model and Context Sources

The communication flow within MCP follows a predictable and structured pattern:

1. **Initiation** – The client or model sends a **request** to a context source (server).
2. **Processing** – The server interprets the request, executes the necessary operations (e.g., querying a database, retrieving an API result), and prepares a response.
3. **Response Delivery** – The server sends back a **response**, which may include raw data, structured results, or error codes.
4. **Event Handling** – At any point, servers can issue **events** to notify clients or models about state changes, streamed outputs, or real-time updates.

This cycle allows MCP to support both **pull-based interactions** (requests by the model) and **push-based updates** (events from the server).

### Protocol Design Principles

MCP’s architecture is guided by four foundational design principles:

1. **Simplicity**

   * Minimal, human-readable message formats.
   * Easy to implement across a wide variety of languages and platforms.

2. **Portability**

   * Independent of specific frameworks or infrastructure.
   * Works equally well in cloud-native environments, edge devices, or local setups.

3. **Flexibility**

   * Supports both synchronous and asynchronous interactions.
   * Extensible message schema to adapt to future use cases.

4. **Interoperability**

   * Designed to bridge heterogeneous systems, enabling AI models to seamlessly integrate with diverse data sources, APIs, and tools.
