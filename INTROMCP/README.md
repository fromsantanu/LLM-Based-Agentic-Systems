# üìò Topics: **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**

## 1. [Introduction to MCP](#)

* What is the Model Context Protocol?
* Why MCP is needed in modern AI ecosystems
* Key goals: standardization, interoperability, extensibility

## 2. [Core Concepts of MCP](#)

* Context in AI models (definition and importance)
* Roles of clients, servers, and models in MCP
* How MCP differs from APIs and SDKs

## 3. [MCP Architecture](#)

* High-level architecture overview
* Message types (requests, responses, events)
* Communication flow between model and context sources
* Protocol design principles (simplicity, portability, flexibility)

## 4. [MCP Data Structures](#)

* Context objects and metadata
* Schema definitions and validation
* Examples of standard context types (files, databases, web APIs, sensors)

## 5. [MCP Communication](#)

* Transport layers (WebSockets, HTTP/JSON, etc.)
* Request/response lifecycle
* Event-driven communication in MCP

## 6. [MCP Servers](#)

* What is an MCP server?
* Setting up an MCP server
* Exposing tools and resources via MCP
* Use cases: connecting databases, APIs, external systems

## 7. [MCP Clients](#)

* What is an MCP client?
* Integrating MCP clients with LLMs and agent frameworks
* Authentication and security in client-server interaction
* Example: ChatGPT + MCP client

## 8. [Use Cases of MCP](#)

* Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with MCP
* Agentic AI workflows with MCP servers
* Connecting enterprise systems (CRM, ERP, EHR)
* Research and productivity (summarization, Q\&A over documents)

## 9. [MCP in Agentic Systems](#)

* Multi-agent collaboration using MCP
* Orchestrating workflows across different MCP servers
* Interoperability between LangChain, N8N, LlamaIndex, and MCP

## 10. [MCP Tools & Extensions](#)

* Built-in tool definitions
* Adding custom tools to MCP
* Extending MCP for domain-specific applications (e.g., healthcare, finance)

## 11. [MCP and Security](#)

* Context privacy and access control
* Preventing data leakage in context sharing
* Compliance with standards (HIPAA, GDPR, etc.)

## 12. [MCP in Practice](#)

* Installing and configuring MCP SDKs
* Example: Writing a simple MCP server in Python
* Example: Connecting an MCP client to a vector database

## 13. [MCP Ecosystem](#)

* Current implementations and libraries
* Open-source projects using MCP
* Comparison with other interoperability frameworks

## 14. [Advanced MCP Concepts](#)

* Streaming contexts and real-time updates
* Multi-modal context (text, images, audio, video)
* Scaling MCP for enterprise and distributed systems

## 15. [Future of MCP](#)

* Roadmap and community governance
* MCP‚Äôs role in shaping agentic AI and interoperability
* Predictions: MCP as the ‚ÄúAPI of AI Context‚Äù
