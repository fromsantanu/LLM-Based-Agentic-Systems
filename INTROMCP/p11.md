# **Chapter 11. MCP and Security**

Security is a foundational requirement for any protocol that handles contextual data. Since the Model Context Protocol (MCP) enables models to access and interact with diverse external resources (files, APIs, databases, sensors), protecting data privacy, ensuring integrity, and complying with global regulations is essential. This chapter explores how MCP addresses these challenges through context privacy, access control, data leakage prevention, and compliance with industry standards.

## Context Privacy and Access Control

* **Granular permissions**
  MCP servers should expose resources and tools with fine-grained access controls. This means defining not only *who* can access a resource but also *what level* of access (read-only, write, query, restricted fields).

* **Role-based access control (RBAC)**
  Clients, models, and services connecting via MCP should be authenticated and assigned roles. Each role dictates allowable operations. For example:

  * Researchers may only query anonymized datasets.
  * Administrators may manage tool configurations.
  * Models may only request data relevant to the active session context.

* **Context scoping**
  Context objects should be bound to a specific session or request to avoid accidental exposure across different users or tasks. A temporary context scope reduces risks of persistence beyond its intended use.

* **Audit and monitoring**
  Access to sensitive resources should be logged. Audit trails help trace who accessed what, when, and under which permissions, supporting accountability and compliance checks.

## Preventing Data Leakage in Context Sharing

* **Least privilege principle**
  Context should only include data necessary for the model to perform a task. Avoid over-sharing or bundling irrelevant fields (e.g., providing entire medical records when only lab test values are needed).

* **Redaction and anonymization**
  Personal identifiers (names, addresses, ID numbers) can be masked, tokenized, or removed before passing to the model. For healthcare or legal domains, pseudonymization helps maintain utility while protecting privacy.

* **Secure serialization**
  When transmitting context data, MCP should employ secure serialization formats with input validation to prevent injection attacks or schema misuse.

* **Isolation of contexts**
  Different clients or tasks should never share memory or state without explicit design. Models should be prevented from cross-leaking context between unrelated requests.

* **Output monitoring**
  Just as important as input filtering, outputs should be checked for potential leaks of sensitive context. For example, preventing models from echoing back raw data unintentionally.

## Compliance with Standards (HIPAA, GDPR, etc.)

* **HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act)**
  In healthcare scenarios, MCP systems must:

  * Implement safeguards for Protected Health Information (PHI).
  * Ensure only authorized entities access PHI.
  * Provide de-identification when PHI is used for training or analysis.

* **GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)**
  In EU contexts, MCP implementations must align with GDPR principles:

  * *Data minimization*: Only process data strictly necessary.
  * *Right to be forgotten*: Support deletion of user data on request.
  * *Transparency*: Provide clarity about what data is being used and for what purpose.

* **Other regulatory frameworks**

  * **CCPA** (California Consumer Privacy Act) — opt-out of personal data sale.
  * **ISO/IEC 27001** — information security management controls.
  * **SOC 2** — auditing standards for data security, availability, and confidentiality.

MCP deployments should adopt a compliance-by-design approach, embedding these requirements into context schemas, authentication layers, and logging systems.

✅ **Key Takeaway:**
MCP’s power to connect models with diverse external contexts comes with heightened security responsibilities. By enforcing strict access control, preventing leakage, and aligning with regulatory frameworks like HIPAA and GDPR, MCP ensures that contextual intelligence does not come at the expense of privacy and trust.
