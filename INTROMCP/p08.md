# **Chapter 8. Use Cases of MCP**

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is designed to enable seamless integration between AI models and external systems. By standardizing communication and context sharing, MCP unlocks a wide range of powerful use cases across industries. Below are some of the most impactful applications.

## Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with MCP

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances the capabilities of language models by grounding responses in external data sources. MCP provides a clean interface to connect models with structured and unstructured repositories.

* **Vector Databases**: MCP servers can expose vector search over embeddings, enabling the model to fetch relevant chunks of text for precise answers.
* **Document Stores**: AI models can query MCP servers linked to enterprise wikis, research libraries, or regulatory documents.
* **Dynamic Knowledge**: MCP ensures the context provided to the model is always fresh, reducing hallucinations and improving factual accuracy.

**Example**: A compliance officer queries regulations. MCP retrieves relevant laws from a legal database, enabling the model to generate a fact-based summary.

## Agentic AI Workflows with MCP Servers

MCP also serves as the backbone for agent-based systems, where AI models act as decision-making agents orchestrating tasks across tools and APIs.

* **Task Chaining**: Agents call MCP servers to execute multi-step workflows, such as data collection, transformation, and reporting.
* **Event-Driven Automation**: MCP’s event-based communication allows agents to respond to triggers in real time.
* **Human-in-the-Loop**: By structuring communication through MCP, agents can pause, request input, and resume execution.

**Example**: In a medical support system, an agent uses MCP to gather lab results, cross-check treatment guidelines, and generate draft reports for physician review.

## Connecting Enterprise Systems (CRM, ERP, EHR)

One of MCP’s strengths lies in bridging AI with mission-critical enterprise platforms.

* **CRM (Customer Relationship Management)**: AI assistants powered by MCP can retrieve customer histories, suggest next actions, or automate ticket resolution.
* **ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning)**: MCP servers expose inventory, supply chain, and finance data, enabling AI to generate insights or forecast demand.
* **EHR (Electronic Health Records)**: MCP allows models to pull structured patient data securely, supporting clinical decision support, diagnostics, and treatment planning.

**Example**: A sales AI assistant queries a CRM via MCP to prepare a personalized customer briefing before a meeting.

## Research and Productivity (Summarization, Q\&A over Documents)

MCP empowers researchers, students, and knowledge workers by linking models with large document collections.

* **Summarization**: MCP servers can feed chunks of academic papers, meeting transcripts, or reports into the model for concise digests.
* **Q\&A over Documents**: With RAG, MCP enables interactive Q\&A on research papers, contracts, or datasets.
* **Collaborative Research**: Teams can standardize document access via MCP servers, ensuring consistency and reproducibility.

**Example**: A researcher uploads a batch of clinical trial results. Through MCP, the AI can summarize findings, answer specific questions, and highlight anomalies.

✅ **In summary**, MCP use cases range from powering RAG pipelines to enabling complex agentic workflows, integrating with enterprise systems, and boosting productivity for research and knowledge work. Its flexibility makes MCP a foundational layer for the next generation of AI-driven applications.
