# 8. Hands-On Learning

Generative AI is best understood not just by reading concepts but by building small, practical projects. In this chapter, we explore how to take your first steps—from experimenting with text generation to creating simple images—while gradually building confidence through hands-on practice.

## 8.1 Getting Started with Prompt Engineering

Prompt engineering is the practice of crafting inputs that guide generative models to produce the desired output. A well-structured prompt can make the difference between vague results and highly targeted, creative responses.

* **Basic Approach**: Start with a clear instruction. Example:

  * *“Write a 200-word summary of the importance of renewable energy for high school students.”*
* **Iterative Refinement**: Test the prompt, review the response, then adjust wording, tone, or detail level.
* **Techniques**:

  * **Zero-shot prompting**: No examples provided—directly ask for the task.
  * **Few-shot prompting**: Provide examples to guide the model’s style or structure.
  * **Chain-of-thought prompting**: Encourage step-by-step reasoning by asking the model to “think out loud.”

> **Tip:** Treat prompt design as an experimental process. Try different phrasing and compare outcomes.

## 8.2 Simple Text Generation with OpenAI API

Once you understand basic prompting, you can interact with a model programmatically using the OpenAI API.

### Example in Python

```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI()

response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4o-mini",
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant for creative writing."},
        {"role": "user", "content": "Write a short bedtime story about a rabbit and the moon."}
    ],
    max_tokens=150
)

print(response.choices[0].message.content)
```

* **Key Parameters**:

  * `model`: Which generative model to use.
  * `messages`: Conversation context, including user and system instructions.
  * `max_tokens`: Controls output length.

This produces a short story that can be further customized with refined prompts.

## 8.3 Building Your First Image Generation Project

Generative AI also allows creation of images from text descriptions. A simple example can be built with the OpenAI Images API.

### Example in Python

```python
from openai import OpenAI
import base64

client = OpenAI()

result = client.images.generate(
    model="gpt-image-1",
    prompt="A cozy wooden cabin in the snowy mountains at sunrise",
    size="512x512"
)

image_base64 = result.data[0].b64_json
image_bytes = base64.b64decode(image_base64)

with open("cabin.png", "wb") as f:
    f.write(image_bytes)

print("Image saved as cabin.png")
```

This will generate an original image based on your description. You can vary size, style, and detail level in the prompt.

## 8.4 Case Study: Generative AI in Everyday Applications

Let’s look at how hands-on experiments with text and image generation translate into practical, everyday applications:

* **Education**: A teacher uses prompt engineering to create customized quizzes for different student levels.
* **Healthcare**: Doctors generate simplified summaries of medical research papers for patient education.
* **Marketing**: Designers use image generation to produce quick concept art before committing to full campaigns.
* **Personal Use**: Writers brainstorm story ideas and bloggers create illustrations for online posts.

Each of these examples began with small projects—simple prompts and experiments—that grew into impactful applications.

✅ **Summary:** Hands-on learning with generative AI begins by experimenting with prompt engineering, using APIs for text and image generation, and applying these skills to real-world use cases. By practicing small, iterative projects, you gain both confidence and insight into how these models can support creativity, productivity, and problem-solving.
