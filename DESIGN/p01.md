# ðŸ”¹ **Core Agent Patterns (Explained)**

## **1. Single-Agent Pattern**

* **Idea**: One agent handles the entire workflow â€” receives input, processes it, and outputs results.
* **When to Use**:

  * Simple Q\&A systems
  * Lightweight automation (e.g., summarizing emails)
  * Early prototypes where modularity isnâ€™t needed
* **Pros**: Easy to build, fast, low overhead.
* **Cons**: Limited scalability, struggles with complex/multi-domain tasks.

---

## **2. Multi-Agent Collaboration**

* **Idea**: Multiple agents with specialized roles collaborate, sharing messages or artifacts.
* **Example**:

  * *Research Assistant System*: one agent finds sources, another summarizes, another checks citations.
* **When to Use**:

  * Tasks that require diverse expertise (medical, legal, financial combined)
  * Workflows where specialization improves quality
* **Pros**: Higher accuracy, role specialization.
* **Cons**: Requires coordination; can be slower.

## **3. Orchestratorâ€“Worker Pattern**

* **Idea**: One **orchestrator agent** decides what needs to be done and delegates subtasks to **worker agents**.
* **Example**:

  * *Hospital Assistant*: orchestrator interprets doctorâ€™s request â†’ worker agents handle lab report analysis, patient history retrieval, and prescription drafting.
* **When to Use**:

  * Complex tasks that can be decomposed into smaller subtasks
  * Clear need for control and delegation
* **Pros**: Structured workflow, modular design.
* **Cons**: Orchestrator can become a bottleneck.

---

## **4. Hierarchical Agent Pattern**

* **Idea**: Agents are structured in a tree-like hierarchy. Higher-level agents set goals; lower-level agents execute detailed tasks.
* **Example**:

  * *Business Consultant Agent*:

    * CEO agent â†’ Strategy agent â†’ Finance agent + Marketing agent â†’ Report generator agent
* **When to Use**:

  * Strategic planning, project management
  * Multi-stage pipelines with dependencies
* **Pros**: Clear accountability, scalable.
* **Cons**: Can become rigid if tasks are dynamic.

---

## **5. Supervisor Pattern**

* **Idea**: A **supervisor agent** doesnâ€™t perform tasks but monitors others, ensuring compliance, quality, or safety.
* **Example**:

  * *Healthcare Workflow*: Supervisor ensures diagnostic agent doesnâ€™t skip mandatory safety checks before recommending treatment.
* **When to Use**:

  * High-stakes domains (medicine, law, finance)
  * Any workflow where auditing or governance is critical
* **Pros**: Reliability, safety, compliance.
* **Cons**: Adds overhead; requires defining strict rules.

| Pattern             | Key Role                       | Use Case                         | Pros                | Cons                     |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------ | -------------------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Single-Agent        | One agent does all             | Chatbot, summarizer              | Simple, fast        | Limited scope            |
| Multi-Agent         | Specialized agents collaborate | Research team, medical support   | Expertise, accuracy | Coordination complexity  |
| Orchestratorâ€“Worker | Boss delegates to workers      | Hospital assistant, project mgmt | Modular, controlled | Orchestrator bottleneck  |
| Hierarchical        | Tree of agents (top-down)      | Strategy â†’ execution             | Scalable, organized | Can be rigid             |
| Supervisor          | Oversees, audits others        | Healthcare, finance              | Safe, reliable      | Slower, extra complexity |

ðŸ‘‰ These **core patterns often get combined**. For example, a **Hierarchical system** usually has a **Supervisor** agent built in for safety.
