# 🔹 **Task Execution Patterns**

## **11. ReAct (Reason + Act) Pattern**

* **Idea**: The agent alternates between *reasoning* (thinking step-by-step) and *acting* (calling tools or APIs).
* **Example**:

  * A diagnostic assistant:

    1. Reason → “Patient has fever and cough. Possible TB or pneumonia.”
    2. Act → Calls lab report API.
    3. Reason → “Report shows TB bacteria present.”
    4. Final Answer → “Diagnosis: TB. Suggest treatment plan.”
* **When to Use**:

  * Any task requiring both logical reasoning and tool use.
* **Pros**: Transparent, flexible, handles uncertainty well.
* **Cons**: Can be slower; requires monitoring to avoid looping.

## **12. Plan-and-Execute Pattern**

* **Idea**: Agent first creates a **plan** (high-level steps), then executes them one by one.
* **Example**:

  * *Health Assistant*:

    * Plan → Step 1: Collect symptoms, Step 2: Order tests, Step 3: Recommend treatment.
    * Execute → Runs each step sequentially.
* **When to Use**:

  * Multi-stage processes where order matters.
* **Pros**: Structured, predictable.
* **Cons**: Plan may fail if unexpected input arises.

## **13. Toolformer Pattern**

* **Idea**: Agent autonomously learns **when** and **how** to call external tools.
* **Example**:

  * A finance agent decides on its own when to call a stock price API or when to use a calculator.
* **When to Use**:

  * Environments with multiple APIs / tools
  * Agents expected to adapt to new tools
* **Pros**: Flexible, adaptive.
* **Cons**: Requires careful training/fine-tuning.

## **14. Reflection / Self-Critique Pattern**

* **Idea**: Agent generates an answer, then **reviews or critiques its own output** before presenting it.
* **Example**:

  * A medical agent drafts a treatment → runs self-check against guidelines → corrects dosage before giving to user.
* **When to Use**:

  * High-risk domains (medicine, law, education)
* **Pros**: Improves reliability, reduces errors.
* **Cons**: Extra compute cost; may “over-criticize” and stall.

---

## **15. Simulation Pattern**

* **Idea**: Agent simulates multiple possible scenarios and compares results.
* **Example**:

  * A treatment planner simulates **3 recovery plans** (drug A, drug B, lifestyle change) → compares predicted recovery times → suggests best one.
* **When to Use**:

  * Strategy, forecasting, policy analysis.
* **Pros**: Robust, explores alternatives.
* **Cons**: Computationally expensive.

| Pattern          | Key Mechanism             | Example Use                       | Pros                  | Cons               |
| ---------------- | ------------------------- | --------------------------------- | --------------------- | ------------------ |
| **ReAct**        | Reason ↔ Act loop         | TB diagnosis with lab test API    | Flexible, transparent | May loop           |
| **Plan-Execute** | Plan first, then run      | Patient intake → test → treatment | Structured            | Brittle to changes |
| **Toolformer**   | Agent learns tool usage   | Finance agent w/ APIs             | Adaptive              | Needs training     |
| **Reflection**   | Self-review before output | Doctor agent checks dosage        | Reliable              | Slower             |
| **Simulation**   | Try scenarios & compare   | Recovery plan comparison          | Robust                | Heavy compute      |

👉 These patterns often get **combined**. For example, a **Plan-and-Execute agent** might also use **Reflection** after each step.
