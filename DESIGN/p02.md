# üîπ **Memory & Context Patterns**

## **6. Conversation Memory Pattern**

* **Idea**: Store and recall past conversations to maintain continuity.
* **Example**:

  * A patient chatbot remembers that the user already provided their age and does not ask again.
* **When to Use**:

  * Customer service chatbots
  * Healthcare consultations
* **Pros**: Natural interactions, avoids repetition.
* **Cons**: Memory may become too long; risk of irrelevant recall.

## **7. Scratchpad / Chain-of-Thought Pattern**

* **Idea**: Agent uses an internal ‚Äúnotepad‚Äù to record intermediate reasoning before answering.
* **Example**:

  * A diagnostic agent writes down symptom ‚Üí possible causes ‚Üí lab tests ‚Üí final diagnosis before output.
* **When to Use**:

  * Multi-step reasoning problems (math, planning, diagnostics).
* **Pros**: Transparency, better reasoning.
* **Cons**: May be verbose; requires pruning.

## **8. Long-Term Knowledge Store Pattern**

* **Idea**: Store knowledge in an external memory (e.g., vector database, knowledge graph) and let the agent query it.
* **Example**:

  * A law assistant keeps a vector DB of case law and retrieves relevant precedents during a consultation.
* **When to Use**:

  * Knowledge-intensive workflows
  * Situations requiring persistent facts across sessions
* **Pros**: Scalable memory, reliable fact recall.
* **Cons**: Requires retrieval infra; risk of irrelevant recall if embeddings are poor.

---

## **9. Role-Play Pattern**

* **Idea**: Fix an agent‚Äôs *persona* (doctor, lawyer, teacher) to provide domain-specific context and consistent style.
* **Example**:

  * A health assistant always speaks as a ‚Äúfamily doctor,‚Äù not as a generic chatbot.
* **When to Use**:

  * Domain-specific agents
  * Training consistency across multi-agent systems
* **Pros**: Stable personality, better trust.
* **Cons**: Hard to switch roles mid-conversation.

---

## **10. Stateful Agent Pattern**

* **Idea**: Agent maintains structured state across steps (like variables in a program).
* **Example**:

  * In patient treatment: `{diagnosis: TB, stage: 2, prescribed_meds: Rifampicin}` stored as a JSON object.
* **When to Use**:

  * Workflows with multiple stages (diagnosis ‚Üí treatment ‚Üí monitoring).
* **Pros**: Reliable, structured, easy integration with external apps.
* **Cons**: Requires careful schema design and state management.

| Pattern             | Key Role                     | Example Use                        | Pros                     | Cons                  |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------ | --------------------- |
| Conversation Memory | Recall past dialogue         | Chatbot remembers patient‚Äôs age    | Natural flow             | Memory bloat          |
| Scratchpad / CoT    | Write intermediate reasoning | Symptom ‚Üí cause ‚Üí test ‚Üí diagnosis | Transparency             | Verbose               |
| Long-Term Store     | External DB for knowledge    | Legal assistant with case law DB   | Scalable, reliable facts | Needs retrieval infra |
| Role-Play           | Persona shaping              | Doctor agent vs Teacher agent      | Consistent behavior      | Inflexible            |
| Stateful Agent      | Track structured variables   | Patient state `{stage: 2}`         | Precise, reusable        | Requires schema       |

üëâ Together, these patterns allow agents to feel **‚Äúaware‚Äù** of history, context, and identity ‚Äî turning them from one-off responders into *long-term assistants*.
