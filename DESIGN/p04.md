# üîπ **Interaction & Workflow Patterns**

## **16. Human-in-the-Loop Pattern**

* **Idea**: Agent pauses at key points to request human approval, feedback, or correction.
* **Example**:

  * *Healthcare Assistant*: Before finalizing a prescription, the system shows draft recommendations to the doctor for confirmation.
* **When to Use**:

  * High-stakes tasks (medicine, law, finance)
* **Pros**: Safety, trust, accountability.
* **Cons**: Slower, requires human availability.

---

## **17. Parallel Agent Pattern**

* **Idea**: Multiple agents run subtasks **simultaneously**, and results are merged.
* **Example**:

  * *Patient Report Generator*:

    * Agent A analyzes lab results.
    * Agent B summarizes patient history.
    * Agent C drafts a treatment note.
    * Orchestrator merges into one report.
* **When to Use**:

  * Tasks with independent subtasks (faster turnaround).
* **Pros**: Speed, efficiency.
* **Cons**: Requires careful result merging.

---

## **18. Round-Table Debate Pattern**

* **Idea**: Multiple agents generate answers, then **debate or vote** to reach the best conclusion.
* **Example**:

  * *Diagnosis System*: 3 agents propose different diagnoses ‚Üí Judge agent compares arguments ‚Üí Final decision is most supported.
* **When to Use**:

  * Ambiguous problems with multiple perspectives.
* **Pros**: More balanced, robust answers.
* **Cons**: Computationally expensive, may conflict.

---

## **19. Routing Pattern**

* **Idea**: A **router agent** directs tasks to the most suitable expert agent or workflow.
* **Example**:

  * *Medical Assistant*: Router decides ‚Üí

    * Symptoms query ‚Üí Diagnostic agent
    * Billing question ‚Üí Admin agent
    * Emergency keyword ‚Üí Triage agent
* **When to Use**:

  * Multi-domain systems needing specialization.
* **Pros**: Efficiency, role clarity.
* **Cons**: Router must be accurate (else misroutes).

---

## **20. Recovery / Fallback Pattern**

* **Idea**: If one agent fails, another takes over or retries with a safer approach.
* **Example**:

  * *Emergency Bot*: If the diagnostic agent crashes, fallback ‚Üí default to ‚ÄúRefer to ER immediately.‚Äù
* **When to Use**:

  * Critical reliability scenarios.
* **Pros**: Robustness, continuity.
* **Cons**: Adds redundancy overhead.

| Pattern                 | Mechanism                   | Example Use                  | Pros                   | Cons               |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------- | ---------------------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------ |
| **Human-in-the-Loop**   | Human confirms/edits        | Doctor approves prescription | Safety, trust          | Slower             |
| **Parallel Agents**     | Agents run simultaneously   | Lab ‚Üí history ‚Üí treatment    | Fast, efficient        | Merging complexity |
| **Round-Table Debate**  | Agents argue, judge decides | Multiple diagnoses           | Balanced answers       | Expensive          |
| **Routing**             | Router selects best agent   | Triage patient queries       | Efficient, clear roles | Misrouting risk    |
| **Recovery / Fallback** | Backup handles failure      | Default to ER advice         | Robust, safe           | Extra overhead     |

‚úÖ These **interaction & workflow patterns** are crucial for real-world systems, because they make agents **usable, safe, and reliable**. For example, a **Healthcare AI Assistant** would almost always combine:

* **Routing** (decide which agent to use),
* **Human-in-the-Loop** (doctor oversight), and
* **Fallback** (safety net).
