# 9. **Design Patterns for Agentic Systems**

Agentic systems, like complex software architectures, benefit from **design patterns**—reusable solutions to recurring problems in autonomy, reasoning, and coordination. These patterns define how agents think, act, and interact, ensuring systems are scalable, adaptable, and reliable. Below are five foundational design patterns shaping today’s agentic AI.

---

## **1. ReAct (Reason + Act) Agents**

The **ReAct** pattern combines reasoning (thought processes) with action (tool use, environment manipulation). Instead of separating planning from execution, the agent interleaves them:

* **Reason step**: Generate a chain-of-thought explaining the next move.
* **Act step**: Execute an action (API call, tool use, query).
* **Observe**: Take in feedback from the environment.
* **Loop**: Iterate reasoning and acting until the task is complete.

**Advantages:**

* Transparent decision-making.
* Ability to handle uncertainty and adjust in real-time.
* Natural fit for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) tasks.

**Example:**
A medical assistant reasoning about symptoms (“Patient has fever, cough, high CRP → likely infection”) before calling the lab API to fetch relevant blood test data.

## **2. Chain-of-Thought vs. Action-Execution**

Designing agents often involves balancing **thinking** and **acting**:

* **Chain-of-Thought (CoT):**
  Agents generate extended reasoning steps before making a decision. Useful in tasks requiring deep logic (e.g., mathematical proofs, diagnosis).

* **Action-Execution:**
  Agents skip detailed internal reasoning and quickly act based on heuristics or learned policies. Useful for fast responses in stable environments (e.g., robot navigation).

**Trade-offs:**

* CoT → accuracy, explainability, slower speed.
* Action-Execution → efficiency, but higher risk of error in ambiguous tasks.

**Hybrid pattern:** Some agents reason deeply only when uncertainty is high, otherwise act directly.

## **3. Hierarchical Agent Frameworks (Planner–Executor–Critic)**

Complex tasks are decomposed using **hierarchies of agents**:

1. **Planner:** Breaks down high-level goals into sub-goals or steps.
2. **Executor(s):** Perform specific tasks (tool use, computation, external action).
3. **Critic/Monitor:** Evaluates outcomes, detects errors, suggests corrections.

**Benefits:**

* Modular structure, easier debugging.
* Supports delegation and specialization.
* Robustness through self-checking loops.

**Example:**
In a surgical support system:

* Planner outlines procedure steps.
* Executors control robotic arms and monitoring devices.
* Critic ensures actions align with safety protocols.

## **4. Swarm Intelligence and Collective Behavior**

Inspired by natural systems (ants, bees, birds), **swarm intelligence** emerges from **simple agents following local rules**, producing coordinated global behavior.

**Key principles:**

* Local interactions → global order.
* No central control; robustness against failure.
* Scalability with number of agents.

**Applications:**

* Drone fleets for search-and-rescue.
* Traffic management via self-organizing vehicles.
* Distributed optimization in logistics.

**Challenges:**
Ensuring safety, preventing chaotic or unintended emergent patterns, and aligning swarm behavior with human goals.

## **5. Orchestration of Multiple Agents**

When multiple specialized agents coexist, **orchestration** ensures they collaborate effectively. Orchestration may involve:

* **Centralized orchestration:** A master agent directs sub-agents.
* **Decentralized orchestration:** Agents negotiate and share tasks dynamically.
* **Hybrid orchestration:** Combines centralized planning with local autonomy.

**Coordination mechanisms:**

* Shared memory or blackboards.
* Message passing and negotiation protocols.
* Market-based or auction-style task allocation.

**Example:**
In enterprise AI:

* A retrieval agent fetches data.
* A reasoning agent synthesizes insights.
* A reporting agent generates a dashboard.
  Orchestration ensures the workflow is seamless and fault-tolerant.

---

## **Summary**

Design patterns provide **structured blueprints** for building agentic systems:

* **ReAct** interleaves thought and action.
* **CoT vs. Execution** balances reasoning depth with efficiency.
* **Hierarchical frameworks** separate planning, execution, and evaluation.
* **Swarm intelligence** leverages distributed simplicity for emergent complexity.
* **Orchestration** enables collaboration among specialized agents.

Together, these patterns form the backbone of scalable, adaptive, and intelligent multi-agent ecosystems.
