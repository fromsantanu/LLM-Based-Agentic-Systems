## 1. [**Foundations of Agentic Systems**](https://github.com/fromsantanu/LLM-Based-Agentic-Systems/blob/main/AGENTSYS/p01.md)

* What is an agent? (definitions in AI and systems theory)
* Characteristics of agentic systems: autonomy, proactivity, adaptability, interactivity
* Historical roots: from expert systems to autonomous agents
* Agents vs. traditional automation

## 2. [**Core Principles**](https://github.com/fromsantanu/LLM-Based-Agentic-Systems/blob/main/AGENTSYS/p02.md)

* Autonomy: independent decision-making
* Goal-directed behavior: setting and pursuing objectives
* Environment awareness and sensing
* Reasoning, planning, and acting
* Feedback loops and learning
* Context-awareness and adaptability

## 3. [**Architectures of Agentic Systems**](https://github.com/fromsantanu/LLM-Based-Agentic-Systems/blob/main/AGENTSYS/p03.md)

* Reactive agents vs. deliberative agents
* Hybrid architectures
* Belief–Desire–Intention (BDI) model
* Layered and modular design principles
* Multi-agent system architectures

## 4. [**Cognition and Reasoning in Agents**](https://github.com/fromsantanu/LLM-Based-Agentic-Systems/blob/main/AGENTSYS/p04.md)

* Knowledge representation for agents
* Planning and scheduling
* Decision-making under uncertainty
* Rule-based vs. learning-based reasoning
* Reflection and self-correction in agentic systems

## 5. [**Communication and Interaction**](https://github.com/fromsantanu/LLM-Based-Agentic-Systems/blob/main/AGENTSYS/p05.md)

* Human–agent interaction principles
* Multi-agent collaboration and coordination
* Negotiation, cooperation, and competition
* Natural language and symbolic communication
* Tool use and API interactions

## 6. [**Learning in Agentic Systems**](https://github.com/fromsantanu/LLM-Based-Agentic-Systems/blob/main/AGENTSYS/p06.md)

* Reinforcement learning in agents
* Online vs. offline learning
* Meta-learning for adaptability
* Experience replay and memory in agents
* Self-improvement cycles

## 7. [**Context and Memory**](https://github.com/fromsantanu/LLM-Based-Agentic-Systems/blob/main/AGENTSYS/p07.md)

* Short-term vs. long-term memory
* Episodic and semantic memory for agents
* Contextual grounding and continuity
* Knowledge retrieval and augmentation (RAG principles)

## 8. [**Control and Governance**](https://github.com/fromsantanu/LLM-Based-Agentic-Systems/blob/main/AGENTSYS/p08.md)

* Supervisory vs. fully autonomous agents
* Safety, reliability, and alignment
* Ethical considerations in agent design
* Guardrails and constraints in decision-making
* Human-in-the-loop vs. human-on-the-loop models

## 9. [**Design Patterns for Agentic Systems**](https://github.com/fromsantanu/LLM-Based-Agentic-Systems/blob/main/AGENTSYS/p09.md)

* ReAct (Reason + Act) agents
* Chain-of-thought vs. action-execution
* Hierarchical agent frameworks (planner–executor–critic)
* Swarm intelligence and collective behavior
* Orchestration of multiple agents

## 10. [**Applications of Agentic Systems**](https://github.com/fromsantanu/LLM-Based-Agentic-Systems/blob/main/AGENTSYS/p10.md)

* Conversational assistants and copilots
