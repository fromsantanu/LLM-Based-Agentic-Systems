# 3. **Architectures of Agentic Systems**

The architecture of an agent defines how it perceives its environment, reasons about it, and acts upon it. In agentic systems, architecture is not just about computational efficiency—it determines the very nature of autonomy, adaptability, and coordination. Different paradigms have been proposed over the years, each balancing between reactivity (fast responses) and deliberation (thoughtful planning). This chapter explores the core architectural models.

## Reactive Agents vs. Deliberative Agents

### Reactive Agents

* **Definition**: Agents that respond directly to environmental stimuli without maintaining an internal model of the world.
* **Characteristics**:

  * Fast, lightweight, and robust in dynamic environments.
  * Limited reasoning—behaviors are typically rule-based (“if condition, then action”).
* **Example**: A thermostat regulating temperature, or a robotic vacuum navigating around obstacles.

### Deliberative Agents

* **Definition**: Agents that maintain symbolic models of the world and use reasoning or planning to decide on actions.
* **Characteristics**:

  * Computationally intensive but capable of long-term strategies.
  * Can evaluate multiple action sequences and outcomes.
* **Example**: An AI assistant scheduling tasks, considering deadlines, dependencies, and user preferences.

**Trade-off**: Reactive agents excel in speed and robustness, while deliberative agents excel in flexibility and foresight.

## Hybrid Architectures

Since neither pure reactivity nor pure deliberation is sufficient in complex domains, hybrid architectures combine the strengths of both.

* **Structure**: Typically includes:

  * A **reactive layer** for immediate responses.
  * A **deliberative layer** for higher-level planning.
  * A **coordination mechanism** to manage conflicts between layers.
* **Examples**:

  * **Subsumption Architecture** (Brooks): Layered system where higher levels can override lower-level behaviors.
  * **Three-layer architecture**: Divides the system into perception (reactive), planning (deliberative), and execution (coordination).

## Belief–Desire–Intention (BDI) Model

One of the most influential agent models, inspired by human practical reasoning.

* **Beliefs**: The agent’s knowledge or information about the world.
* **Desires**: The goals or states of the world the agent would like to achieve.
* **Intentions**: The commitments the agent makes to pursue certain desires, shaping its future actions.

**Advantages**:

* Provides a structured way to handle conflicting goals.
* Supports reasoning about future commitments while adapting to changing environments.

**Applications**:

* Personal assistants (deciding which task to prioritize).
* Autonomous vehicles (choosing a safe and efficient route).

## Layered and Modular Design Principles

Agent architectures often adopt **layered** or **modular** designs for scalability and maintainability.

* **Layered Design**:

  * Each layer has a specific function (perception, reasoning, action).
  * Allows separation of concerns and easier debugging.

* **Modular Design**:

  * Agents are built from interchangeable components (e.g., sensor modules, planning modules).
  * Promotes reusability and customization across domains.

**Principle**: A well-structured architecture enables complex agents to evolve without rewriting the entire system.

## Multi-Agent System Architectures

In many real-world applications, agents rarely act alone. Multi-agent systems (MAS) involve distributed collections of agents working together—or competing—within a shared environment.

* **Architectural Models**:

  * **Centralized**: A central agent coordinates the actions of others (like an air traffic control system).
  * **Decentralized**: Agents operate autonomously and coordinate through communication (like a swarm of drones).
  * **Hierarchical**: Agents are organized in levels, with higher-level agents supervising lower-level ones.

* **Key Features**:

  * **Coordination**: Ensuring agents’ actions are aligned.
  * **Communication**: Exchanging knowledge, beliefs, or intentions.
  * **Emergence**: Complex group behaviors arise from simple local rules.

**Applications**: Smart grids, logistics optimization, multi-robot exploration, and large-scale simulations.

## Summary

Architectures of agentic systems range from simple reactive loops to complex deliberative reasoning frameworks, with hybrids bridging the gap. The BDI model offers a cognitive lens, while layered and modular designs ensure scalability. At the collective level, multi-agent architectures enable distributed intelligence, supporting coordination in domains as diverse as healthcare, robotics, and economics.

**Key takeaway**: Choosing the right architecture is not just a technical decision but a strategic one, shaping how agents perceive, decide, and act in dynamic environments.
