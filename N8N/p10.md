# Chapter 10 - Healthcare Assistant Agent

Healthcare is one of the most impactful domains for applying **Agentic AI**. A well-designed Healthcare Assistant Agent can guide patients from initial intake, through triage or diagnosis, and then help monitor recovery — all while maintaining structured, auditable data.

## Intake Workflow (Symptoms → Structured JSON)

The first stage is **patient intake**, where raw symptom descriptions are converted into structured data:

1. **Natural Language Input**
   Patients may describe their condition in unstructured text:

   > "I’ve had a fever and sore throat for three days, with mild headache."

2. **Entity Extraction**
   The agent identifies symptoms, durations, severities, and contextual details.

   * **Symptoms:** fever, sore throat, headache
   * **Duration:** 3 days
   * **Severity:** mild

3. **Structured JSON Representation**
   The agent encodes this data in a machine-usable form:

   ```json
   {
     "patient_id": "12345",
     "symptoms": [
       {"name": "fever", "duration": "3 days", "severity": "moderate"},
       {"name": "sore throat", "duration": "3 days", "severity": "moderate"},
       {"name": "headache", "duration": "3 days", "severity": "mild"}
     ],
     "context": {
       "age": 34,
       "gender": "male",
       "medical_history": ["allergy: penicillin"],
       "onset": "gradual"
     }
   }
   ```

4. **Integration in N8N / LangChain**

   * **LLM node**: for parsing free text into structured JSON.
   * **Validation node**: check completeness and flag missing data.
   * **Database node**: store structured intake for future queries.

## Routing to Diagnosis or Triage

Once the intake is complete, the agent decides the next step:

1. **Triage Rules**

   * **Emergency symptoms** (e.g., chest pain, difficulty breathing) → route to **emergency triage**.
   * **Non-urgent but concerning** (e.g., persistent fever, severe cough) → recommend **clinical consultation**.
   * **Mild cases** (e.g., seasonal cold, minor headache) → suggest **self-care guidance**.

2. **Diagnosis Agent (Optional)**

   * Uses symptom databases (e.g., ICD-10, SNOMED) and vector search to provide **probable conditions**.
   * Presents a **confidence score** and multiple differential diagnoses.
   * Always includes a disclaimer: *“This is not a medical diagnosis; consult a licensed doctor.”*

3. **Workflow in N8N**

   * **Router node**: direct patient data to emergency, routine, or self-care pipelines.
   * **External API integration**: connect with telemedicine platforms or hospital EMRs for escalation.
   * **Supervisor → Worker agent model**: supervisor decides the route; worker agents provide condition-specific recommendations.

## Monitoring Recovery with Reminders

Healthcare doesn’t stop after consultation — monitoring progress is critical:

1. **Recovery Plan JSON**

   ```json
   {
     "patient_id": "12345",
     "prescriptions": [
       {"medicine": "paracetamol", "dose": "500 mg", "frequency": "3 times/day", "duration": "5 days"}
     ],
     "lifestyle": ["rest", "hydration", "warm salt water gargle"],
     "follow_up": "7 days"
   }
   ```

2. **Automated Reminders**

   * **Medication reminders** via SMS, email, or WhatsApp.
   * **Lifestyle reminders**: hydration alerts, sleep hygiene tips.
   * **Follow-up alerts**: notify patient for doctor revisit or teleconsultation.

3. **Recovery Tracking**

   * Daily symptom check-in forms (“Do you still have fever?”).
   * Structured JSON updates appended to patient record.
   * Detect deterioration (e.g., “fever persists after 5 days”) → trigger escalation.

4. **N8N Implementation**

   * **Scheduler node**: send daily reminders.
   * **Webhook node**: collect patient responses.
   * **Conditional logic**: escalate if worsening symptoms are reported.

✅ With these three components — **intake**, **routing**, and **recovery monitoring** — the Healthcare Assistant Agent creates a continuous loop of patient engagement, ensuring structured data flow, timely escalations, and patient adherence.
