# **Chapter 3 - Core AI Concepts in N8N**

When building **Agentic AI workflows in N8N**, it’s essential to understand the **core concepts** that power intelligent automation: **LLMs**, **embeddings**, **vector databases**, and the architectural distinction between **tools, agents, and chains**. This chapter introduces these concepts and shows how they connect seamlessly within N8N.

## 1. Large Language Models (LLMs)

* **Definition:**
  LLMs (Large Language Models) are AI models trained on massive amounts of text data. They generate human-like responses, summarize information, write code, and perform reasoning tasks.
* **Examples:** OpenAI GPT, Anthropic Claude, HuggingFace Transformers, Google Gemini, Mistral.
* **In N8N:**

  * N8N provides ready-made nodes to connect to LLMs (OpenAI, HuggingFace).
  * You can use them for text generation, summarization, and reasoning tasks within your workflows.
  * Outputs can be passed directly to other N8N nodes for further automation (e.g., send summary to Slack, save in Google Sheets).

## 2. Embeddings

* **Definition:**
  Embeddings are vector representations of text (or images, audio) that capture semantic meaning. Similar concepts have closer vector values.
* **Use cases:**

  * Semantic search (finding similar documents or FAQs)
  * Clustering data by meaning
  * Feeding relevant context into an LLM for RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation).
* **In N8N:**

  * You can generate embeddings with OpenAI or HuggingFace nodes.
  * Store embeddings in a vector database node like **Qdrant** or **Chroma**.
  * Query the database for relevant results and inject them back into the LLM node.

## 3. Vector Databases

* **Definition:**
  Databases optimized for storing and retrieving embeddings efficiently.
* **Examples:** Qdrant, Chroma, Pinecone, Weaviate, FAISS.
* **In N8N:**

  * Dedicated integration nodes exist for Qdrant and Pinecone.
  * You can build pipelines where user input → embedding generation → similarity search → result injection into LLM.
  * This enables **context-aware AI agents** that “remember” knowledge outside their training data.

## 4. Tools, Agents, and Chains

These are the **building blocks of agentic AI** inside and outside N8N:

* **Tools**

  * Individual capabilities (e.g., calculator, web search, database query).
  * In N8N, tools can be represented as nodes (e.g., HTTP request, Google Sheets, MySQL).

* **Chains**

  * Linear sequences of tasks (LLM → Tool → Formatter → Storage).
  * Example: “Summarize a PDF → Translate → Save to Notion.”

* **Agents**

  * Decision-making entities that dynamically choose which tools or chains to execute based on context.
  * Example: An **AI Research Assistant Agent** in N8N that decides whether to search the web, retrieve from vector DB, or directly answer.

## 5. Connecting AI Blocks in N8N

N8N acts as a **canvas for AI workflows**, letting you drag-and-drop these blocks together:

1. **Input Node (Trigger):**
   Start with user input (Webhook, Slack message, email, etc.).

2. **Embedding Node:**
   Convert text into vectors.

3. **Vector Database Node:**
   Search for relevant documents (context retrieval).

4. **LLM Node:**
   Generate a context-aware answer using retrieved information.

5. **Action/Output Node:**
   Send results to another system (Slack, Notion, Google Docs, API).

➡️ Example Workflow:
**Slack Message → OpenAI Embedding → Qdrant Search → GPT Node → Summarized Answer → Slack Reply**

This modular approach allows you to build **scalable, intelligent, and automated pipelines** without coding from scratch.

---

✅ **Key Takeaway:**
In N8N, **LLMs provide reasoning**, **embeddings + vector DBs provide memory**, and **tools/agents/chains provide structure and action**. Connecting them together unlocks the full potential of **Agentic AI workflows**.
