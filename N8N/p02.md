# **Chapter 2 - Getting Started with N8N**

n8n (short for *‚Äúnodemation‚Äù*) is an open-source workflow automation tool that allows you to connect APIs, services, and AI models with minimal coding. For building **Agentic AI systems**, n8n acts as the backbone, enabling automation, orchestration, and integration of different tools into a unified workflow.

## Installing n8n Locally and on the Cloud

You can run n8n in three main ways:

### 1. Local Installation

* **Using npm** (good for testing/development):

  ```bash
  npm install n8n -g
  n8n
  ```

  * Opens n8n at `http://localhost:5678/` by default.
  * Best for experimentation, small projects, or tutorials.

* **Using Docker** (recommended for stability):

  ```bash
  docker run -it --rm \
    -p 5678:5678 \
    -v ~/.n8n:/home/node/.n8n \
    n8nio/n8n
  ```

  * Data is persisted in `~/.n8n`.
  * Makes upgrades and scaling easier.

### 2. Cloud Hosting

* **n8n Cloud (official SaaS):** Fully managed, with updates and scaling handled automatically.
* **VPS Hosting (e.g., Hostinger, AWS, GCP, Azure):**

  * Deploy via Docker or Kubernetes.
  * Provides more control and customization.

üëâ Tip: For **AI-heavy workflows** (e.g., embeddings, RAG pipelines), a VPS with at least 4 GB RAM and persistent storage is recommended.

## Understanding Nodes, Triggers, and Workflows

At its core, n8n workflows are built from **nodes**, connected in a visual canvas.

* **Nodes:**

  * Building blocks that perform actions.
  * Example: ‚ÄúHTTP Request‚Äù node fetches API data, ‚ÄúOpenAI‚Äù node calls GPT, ‚ÄúQdrant‚Äù node stores embeddings.

* **Triggers:**

  * Special nodes that *start* a workflow.
  * Examples:

    * Cron Trigger (time-based automation).
    * Webhook Trigger (waits for API/webhook calls).
    * Manual Trigger (testing from the UI).

* **Workflows:**

  * Combination of nodes and triggers that define an automation pipeline.
  * Example:

    * Trigger: ‚ÄúWebhook‚Äù ‚Üí
    * Node: ‚ÄúOpenAI GPT Response‚Äù ‚Üí
    * Node: ‚ÄúStore in Qdrant‚Äù ‚Üí
    * Node: ‚ÄúSend Email.‚Äù

üëâ Think of workflows as *blueprints of automation*, and nodes as the *steps*.

## Key Integrations for Agentic AI

n8n supports native and custom integrations. For Agentic AI, the most important ones are:

### 1. **OpenAI**

* Use GPT models for text generation, reasoning, summarization, or tool-use.
* Example: Workflow that takes a user query ‚Üí runs it through GPT ‚Üí returns a structured JSON for further automation.

### 2. **HuggingFace**

* Access community AI models (NLP, vision, embeddings).
* Example: Sentiment analysis on customer feedback before routing it to a database.

### 3. **Qdrant**

* A scalable **vector database**.
* Useful for semantic search, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and storing embeddings.
* Example: Workflow ‚Üí Document ingestion ‚Üí Embedding creation ‚Üí Store in Qdrant ‚Üí Retrieve relevant chunks during queries.

### 4. **Chroma**

* Lightweight open-source vector store.
* Ideal for small/medium projects with limited hardware.
* Example: Storing 200‚Äì300 books‚Äô worth of embeddings locally for a research assistant bot.

## Example Workflow (AI-Powered Research Assistant)

1. **Trigger:** Manual input of a research query.
2. **Node 1:** Generate embedding of query (OpenAI or HuggingFace).
3. **Node 2:** Search vector DB (Qdrant/Chroma) for relevant documents.
4. **Node 3:** Summarize results using OpenAI GPT.
5. **Node 4:** Send structured report to email/Slack/Notion.

This demonstrates how n8n acts as a bridge between **AI models** and **vector databases**, enabling an **end-to-end agentic workflow**.

‚úÖ By the end of this chapter, you should be able to:

* Install n8n locally or on the cloud.
* Understand nodes, triggers, and workflows.
* Use key AI integrations: OpenAI, HuggingFace, Qdrant, and Chroma.
* Build your first AI-powered automation pipeline.
